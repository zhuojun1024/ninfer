# NInfer documentation

Start with the [project README](../README.md) to build NInfer, download a published artifact, and
run the CLI or HTTP server.

## User guides

| Document | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [CLI](cli.md) | text, chat-history, image/video input, output streams, sampling, MTP, and common runtime options |
| [HTTP serving](serving.md) | OpenAI Responses/Chat Completions, Anthropic Messages, state, streaming, token counting, authentication, and tool calls |
| [Performance](performance.md) | RTX 5090 measurement coverage, per-model serving results, methodology, and publication rules |
| [Weight conversion](weight-conversion.md) | official recipes, custom formats and sources, conversion methods, optional components and artifact output |
| [Perplexity](perplexity.md) | fixed-corpus and custom-text causal perplexity, comparison rules, progress, and reports |
| [Windows native build](windows.md) | VS2022 + CUDA 13.3 build, native run recipe, verified Windows/WDDM behavior, TP-2 mapped-pinned findings, and platform differences |
| [Dual RTX 5060 Ti TP-2](tp2-dual-5060ti.md) | tensor-parallel-2 server configuration, memory budget, and measurements on two RTX 5060 Ti cards |
| [TP-2 settled decisions](tp2-decisions.md) | quick reference of settled decisions, rejected approaches, and root causes from the TP-2 campaign, with worklog pointers |
| [CLI examples](../examples/cli/) | committed text, multimodal, thinking, long-decode, and long-context inputs |

The executable `--help` output is the exact source for command-line option spelling and defaults.

## Maintainer references

The active references under [`maintainer/`](maintainer/) record current architecture, model,
artifact, and maintenance contracts. These files are not additional user workflows or installed
API documentation.

[Engine architecture](maintainer/engine-architecture.md) is the single top-level reference. The
other references own narrower contracts:

| Document | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| [Engine architecture](maintainer/engine-architecture.md) | model/config/weight ownership, loading-to-execution flow, requests, scheduling, transactions and graphs |
| [Build system](maintainer/build-system.md) | CMake targets, explicit source ownership, CUDA compilation boundaries, presets and developer configuration |
| [Artifact container](maintainer/artifact-container.md) | v3 directory, objects, logical bindings, Uses, resources and file framing/sharding |
| [Numeric formats](maintainer/tensor-formats.md) | represented values, codes/scales, conversion arithmetic and numerical interpretation |
| [Storage layouts](maintainer/storage-layouts.md) | packing, plane offsets, padding, encoded sizes and view addressing |
| [Qwen3.5 model](maintainer/qwen3_5-model.md) | Dense/MoE mathematics, instance config, logical parameters, MTP, Vision and state semantics |
| [DFlash and DFlash2](maintainer/dflash.md) | conditioning, masked draft computation, proposal distributions and backend state |
| [Resource scheduling and context cache](maintainer/resource-scheduling-and-context-cache.md) | candidate selection, retention, materialization and Device/Host checkpoint policy |
| [Paged KV context store](maintainer/paged-kv-cache.md) | typed pools, pages, replicas, address spaces, reservations and consumer views |
| [ReplaySSM GDN](maintainer/replayssm-gdn.md) | raw transition records and faithful commitment of the verified state prefix |
| [Op development](maintainer/op-development.md) | semantic boundaries, source ownership, numerical qualification and performance evidence |
| [Operational logging](maintainer/logging.md) | log ownership, presentation, severity and data policy |
| [Linear benchmark](maintainer/linear-benchmark.md) | pure Linear measurement, metrics and suites |
| [Linear tuning and reports](maintainer/linear-tuning.md) | tuning ranges, priority points, dispatch tradeoffs and final performance report format |

Model cards contain official artifact facts and source provenance. The
[conversion guide](weight-conversion.md) is the entry point for making an artifact. Exact config
fields, parameter expansion and native supported domains are maintained by the code linked from
these references.
