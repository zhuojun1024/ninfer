# Weight conversion

NInfer's converter creates `.ninfer` artifacts from local weights and a Python recipe. A recipe
can reuse an official conversion, change selected layers or projections, combine sources, or call
your own conversion method. The artifact contains the resulting configuration, encoded weights,
logical bindings and frontend resources.

Run the commands below from the repository root.

## Upgrade an existing v2 artifact

The offline upgrade tool supports the official Qwen3.6/3.8-27B groupwise-int and NVFP4 artifacts,
and Qwen3.6-35B-A3B groupwise-int. Update your checkout to the current `master` and
[rebuild NInfer](../README.md#quick-start), then run with Python 3.11:

```bash
python3 tools/upgrade_ninfer_v2_to_v3.py \
  models/qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer \
  models/qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.v3.ninfer
```

The output must use a new path. After upgrading, use it directly or rename it to replace the
original file. Stored weight values and formats are preserved. The upgrade also installs the
matching template from `tools/chat_templates/`. Published SHA-256 checksums apply only to
downloaded files.

## Start with an official recipe

Source-weight conversion requires a Python 3.11 environment with PyTorch and NumPy. It uses CUDA
by default; `--device cpu` selects CPU conversion. The input paths below are placeholders for your
local checkpoint directories.

For Qwen3.6-27B floating-point source weights:

```bash
python3 -m tools.convert \
  --model /path/to/Qwen3.6-27B \
  --recipe qwen3_6_27b \
  --components text,vision,mtp \
  --resource chat_template.jinja=tools/chat_templates/qwen3_6.jinja \
  --proposal \
  --name qwen3.6-27b \
  --out models/qwen3_6_27b.ninfer
```

`--components` defaults to `text`. Include only the optional components you want to distribute.
`--proposal` adds the indexed proposal head used by speculative decoding; it uses the repository's
token ranking and defaults to 131,072 rows. The ordinary full-vocabulary output head is retained.

The built-in recipes are ordinary Python functions in
[`official_recipes.py`](../tools/convert/official_recipes.py):

| Recipe | Main representation choices | Additional source |
|---|---|---|
| `qwen3_6_27b` | Q4/Q5 projections, Q6 vocabulary weights | None |
| `qwen3_8_27b` | Q4/Q5 projections, Q8 vocabulary weights | None |
| `qwen3_6_35b_a3b` | Q4 experts, Q5/Q6 expert down, Q8 shared/projection weights | None |
| `qwen3_6_27b_nvfp4` | Imported NVFP4, selected BF16 projections, Q8 vocabulary weights | `quantized` |
| `qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4` | Imported NVFP4/FP8, FP8 embedding generated from BF16 | `quantized` |

These names select conversion choices. Runtime execution is selected from the architecture,
configuration and actual bindings stored in the artifact. `--name` sets the public model name;
it does not select kernels.

For a Qwen3.8-27B NVFP4/FP8 artifact with DFlash2:

```bash
python3 -m tools.convert \
  --model /path/to/Qwen3.8-27B \
  --recipe qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4 \
  --source quantized=/path/to/Qwen3.8-27B-NVFP4 \
  --source dflash2=/path/to/Qwen3.8-27B-DFlash2 \
  --components text,vision,mtp,dflash2 \
  --resource chat_template.jinja=tools/chat_templates/qwen3_8.jinja \
  --proposal \
  --name qwen3.8-27b \
  --out models/qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer
```

MTP and Vision use the main source. DFlash and DFlash2 use the corresponding named source, supplied
as `--source dflash=PATH` or `--source dflash2=PATH`. An artifact may contain several optional
components; the Engine loads only the ones selected at startup, including at most one speculative
backend. Component availability and startup selection are independent.

## Change part of a recipe

Save the following as `my_recipe.py`:

```python
from tools.convert.official_recipes import qwen3_6_27b


def configure(model, recipe, sources):
    qwen3_6_27b(model, recipe, sources)
    recipe.assign(
        "text/layers/0/mlp/down",
        format="q6_g64_fp16",
        method="grouped_absmax",
    )
```

Run it with the same source and component selection:

```bash
python3 -m tools.convert \
  --model /path/to/Qwen3.6-27B \
  --recipe my_recipe.py \
  --components text,vision,mtp \
  --proposal \
  --out models/my_qwen.ninfer
```

The default entry function is `configure`; `--recipe my_recipe.py:customize` selects another
function. Alternatively, use an official `--recipe` and put only the changes in an `--override`
file. Overrides run after the base recipe and optional proposal-head setup.

`model.parameters` maps logical names to their shape, source and mathematical inputs. To see the
available names for your selected components, a recipe can print them:

```python
for name, parameter in model.parameters.items():
    print(name, parameter.shape, parameter.inputs)
```

`recipe.assign` accepts one name, a list of names, or shell-style patterns such as
`text/layers/*/mlp/down`. A selector that matches nothing fails. Assignments run in Python order;
later assignments replace only the explicitly supplied choices. Changing `format` does not
automatically change `method`. Use `layout="auto"` to select the registered layout for the format
when overriding an earlier explicit layout choice.

The principal choices are:

| Argument | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `format` | Persistent numeric format |
| `layout` | Physical encoding; inferred from format unless explicitly set |
| `method` | Built-in method name or Python callable |
| `source` | Logical values or encoded rows from the selected source |
| `parameters` | JSON-serializable numerical parameters passed to the method |
| `rows=(begin, end)` | Override complete leading-axis rows in a half-open range |
| `activation_policy` | Permission for activation precision at the parameter's mathematical inputs |

For example, `rows=(0, 128)` can give the first 128 rows a different format. This creates multiple
physical parts when necessary. The container can represent that result; the intended Op must also
support consuming those parts. Current native projections generally require a contiguous parent
region, so arbitrary splits of one projection are not automatically executable.

## Formats, methods and activation precision

The converter currently writes these formats:

| Format | Built-in method for floating-point input | Import of already encoded input |
|---|---|---|
| `bf16`, `fp32`, `int32` | `cast_direct` | Direct words through the source reader |
| `q4_g64_fp16`, `q5_g64_fp16`, `q6_g64_fp16`, `q8_g32_fp16` | `grouped_absmax` | Supply a custom method/source if needed |
| `fp8_e4m3fn_row_bf16` | `fp8_row_maxabs` | `import_encoded` |
| `nvfp4` | Supply a custom quantizer | `import_encoded` |

`grouped_absmax` stores one FP16 scale per group and signed integer codes. `fp8_row_maxabs` first
rounds input values to BF16, then produces E4M3FN codes and one BF16 multiplier per row.
`import_encoded` preserves compatible code and scale words, including NVFP4's matrix weight divisor.
It does not dequantize and requantize them.

The exact numeric and packing rules are in [numeric formats](maintainer/tensor-formats.md) and
[storage layouts](maintainer/storage-layouts.md). Source format names alone do not establish
compatibility: scale direction, granularity, code meaning and axis order must also match.

Activation permissions are independent of the stored weight format:

| Policy | Permitted activation paths |
|---|---|
| `A16Only` | A16 |
| `AllowA8` | A16, A8 |
| `AllowA4` | A16, A8, A4 |

They permit choices; they do not force a kernel to use the lowest precision. A fused operation that
shares one activation across several projections must respect the intersection of their
permissions. `recipe.use(parameter, input_name, ...)` can set one mathematical input independently;
the names are available in `parameter.inputs`.

An NVFP4 A4 input requires a positive finite activation divisor. `import_encoded` obtains it from
the selected source, or a recipe supplies it through
`recipe.use(..., auxiliaries={"activation_input_divisor": value})`. Shared weights retain separate
Use records; sharing weights does not share calibration implicitly.

## Fused parents and logical projections

The Qwen adapter exposes Q, K, gate and V separately, even when they came from fused source tensors.
It also supplies finite packing groups for attention, GDN, MLP and MoE. Compatible selections are
packed into a shared parent automatically by the built-in methods.

For the Dense groupwise recipe, attention Q/K form one Q4 parent and gate/V form one Q5 parent.
The native fused Op receives two weights. To use the supported single-parent FP8 form, an override
can assign all four projections together:

```python
def configure(model, recipe, sources):
    for layer, kind in enumerate(model.config["layer_types"]):
        if kind != "full_attention":
            continue
        prefix = f"text/layers/{layer}/attention/"
        recipe.assign(
            [prefix + role for role in ("query", "key", "gate", "value")],
            format="fp8_e4m3fn_row_bf16",
            layout="auto",
            method="fp8_row_maxabs",
            activation_policy="AllowA8",
        )
```

Use this file as `--override` after `qwen3_6_27b` or `qwen3_8_27b`. It leaves the other parameters
under that recipe. The adapter handles source Q/gate row order; the override works with logical
projections. Changing their representation can change numerical results and the physical kernels.

For explicit organization, `recipe.group([names...])` concatenates compatible selections in the
given order, `recipe.separate(names)` disables automatic grouping for those parameters, and
`recipe.share(parameter, target)` binds equal-shaped parameters to the same physical data.
Explicit groups must be disjoint and use unsplit selections with matching format, layout, method
and method parameters. NVFP4 parents also require a common weight divisor. Automatic grouping is
limited to built-in methods; custom methods can request explicit groups.

Grouping chooses storage. Model execution code chooses the supported fused implementation. The
loader uploads the stored representation, without repacking an inconvenient arrangement.

## Read another source

`--model` supplies the main config, default resources and the source named `base`. Add other
Safetensors sources with repeated `--source NAME=PATH`; they are opened when used. Single-file
Safetensors and indexed shards are supported. Additional tensor-only sources can omit model config;
sources carrying config are checked against the relevant model geometry.

To replace a logical parameter from another compatible checkpoint in a recipe:

```python
name = "text/layers/0/mlp/down"
recipe.assign(
    name,
    source=model.source(name, sources["alternate"]),
    format="q6_g64_fp16",
    method="grouped_absmax",
)
```

Supply `--source alternate=/path/to/alternate-checkpoint`. `model.source` applies the architecture's
source-name and axis mapping, including Q/gate extraction. The built-in compressed-tensors reader
understands the implemented per-row FP8 and NVFP4 code/scale conventions. It can expose decoded
values for another quantizer or encoded rows for exact import.

For another file format or quantization convention, provide a `LogicalSource`. Its value reader
accepts flat C-order element bounds and returns exactly that range. For example, a recipe can read
a logical matrix from a NumPy file stored beside the recipe:

```python
from pathlib import Path
import numpy as np
import torch
from tools.convert.sources.logical import LogicalSource


def configure(model, recipe, sources):
    name = "text/layers/0/mlp/down"
    path = Path(__file__).with_name("mlp-down.npy")
    data = np.load(path, mmap_mode="r")
    if tuple(data.shape) != model.parameters[name].shape or not data.flags.c_contiguous:
        raise ValueError("mlp-down.npy must have the logical shape and C-order storage")

    def read_values(begin, end):
        values = data.reshape(-1)[begin:end].astype(np.float32, copy=True)
        return torch.from_numpy(values)

    source = LogicalSource(tuple(data.shape), str(path), read_values)
    recipe.assign(name, source=source, format="q6_g64_fp16", method="grouped_absmax")
```

Use this as an override. The NumPy file must already follow the logical row/column order. For an
unfamiliar quantized source, its reader performs the corresponding decoding before returning
values. To preserve existing compatible encoded words, also provide `read_encoded` returning
`EncodedRows`, and the format's required divisor accessors. Their definitions are in
[`sources/logical.py`](../tools/convert/sources/logical.py).

## Write a conversion method

A method receives a `PrepareRequest` and returns `request.job(produce=...)`. Preparation validates
the target and determines auxiliary values. The `produce` function reads bounded source regions
and writes values or codes/scales through `TensorOutput`; the writer owns placement and file I/O.

This example adds explicit clipping before the existing grouped quantizer. It demonstrates the
method interface; the clipping threshold is a numerical choice made by the recipe author.

```python
import math
import torch
from tools.artifact.formats import QuantFormat, get_format
from tools.convert.quantization.groupwise import quantize_matrix


def clipped_grouped(request):
    if len(request.target.shape) != 2 or not isinstance(
        get_format(request.target.format), QuantFormat
    ):
        raise ValueError("clipped_grouped requires a grouped-integer matrix")
    limit = float(request.parameters["clip"])
    if not math.isfinite(limit) or limit <= 0 or request.rows_per_chunk <= 0:
        raise ValueError("clip and rows_per_chunk must be positive")
    n, k = request.target.shape

    def produce(output):
        for begin in range(0, n, request.rows_per_chunk):
            end = min(n, begin + request.rows_per_chunk)
            values = request.values(begin * k, end * k).reshape(end - begin, k)
            if not bool(torch.isfinite(values).all()):
                raise ValueError("source contains non-finite values")
            encoded = quantize_matrix(
                values.clamp(-limit, limit),
                request.target.format,
                device=request.device,
            )
            output.write_codes(begin, encoded.codes, encoded.scales)

    return request.job(produce=produce)


def configure(model, recipe, sources):
    recipe.assign(
        "text/layers/0/mlp/down",
        format="q6_g64_fp16",
        method=clipped_grouped,
        parameters={"clip": 1.0},
    )
```

Use this as an override. `request.values` traverses the prepared logical inputs in parent order,
including explicit groups. `output.write_codes` performs the registered packing and validates
codes/scales; the method should not duplicate that byte-layout logic. Direct output uses
`output.write_values`. Keep source blocks and temporary device tensors bounded to the method's
working set. `--rows-per-chunk` defaults to 512; custom methods own how they use it.

## Resources, files and inspection

Text includes `tokenizer.json`, `tokenizer_config.json`, `chat_template.jinja` and
`generation_config.json`. Vision adds its image and video processor configs. Resources come from
`--model`; `--resource ROLE=PATH` replaces a selected resource:

```text
--resource chat_template.jinja=/path/to/chat_template.jinja
```

The official conversion examples select these maintained templates:

| Model | Template | Defaults |
|---|---|---|
| Qwen3.6 Dense/MoE | [qwen3_6.jinja](../tools/chat_templates/qwen3_6.jinja) | thinking on; closed-turn reasoning omitted |
| Qwen3.8 | [qwen3_8.jinja](../tools/chat_templates/qwen3_8.jinja) | thinking on; effort `xhigh`; closed-turn reasoning retained |

Use your own Jinja file to change the artifact's default template. A startup
[`--chat-template FILE`](cli.md#text-input) overrides the stored template.
`generation_config.json` is preserved; sampling presets remain determined by the architecture
and explicit application/request settings.

The default maximum file size is 32,000,000,000 bytes, including framing. Smaller artifacts remain
one file. Larger artifacts use an entry such as `models/my_qwen.ninfer` plus
`my_qwen.ninfer.part-0001`, `my_qwen.ninfer.part-0002`, and so on in the same directory. Pass only the
entry path to NInfer and keep all its recorded parts together. `--max-file-bytes` changes the limit.

Conversion writes `models/my_qwen.ninfer.conversion.json` alongside the artifact, recording sources,
methods, formats, component configs, files and timing. Existing output files are not overwritten.
The report is useful for reproducing a recipe; the Engine reads the artifact itself.

```bash
python3 -m tools.artifact.inspect models/my_qwen.ninfer --objects --bindings
python3 -m tools.artifact.inspect models/my_qwen.ninfer --json
```

Inspection reads directory facts without running inference. Conversion rejects missing logical
coverage, invalid source geometry, unsupported encodings and invalid method output. Actual Op
support is checked by consumers during preparation, resource queries, warmup or execution. A
valid file may need additional Op support before its chosen combination can run. Exercise the
phases and optional components you intend to use through the normal [CLI](cli.md) or
[serving](serving.md) route.
