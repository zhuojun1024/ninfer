## Architecture and ownership

- **Fixed TP=2, dense 27B only.** No MoE split, no PP/DP; `--devices <name1>,<name2>`
  selects by GPU name, not index. (worklog §0–§2)
- **Load-time weight splitting; converter untouched.** Materialization reads the
  complete tensor, splits, and uploads per shard; reuses the official 23.7 GB
  artifact. (worklog §2)
- **DFlash2 and MTP are mutually exclusive backends.** Choosing DFlash2 frees
  shard 0's MTP weights (430 MiB) + KV (516 MiB). (worklog L3757–3760)
- **Whole-copy draft is infeasible.** At full context (262,144 / fp8 / MTP K=2)
  free is only 697/1,217 MiB vs a 2.07 GiB/card draft; after splitting ~1.04
  GiB/card. The proposal condition is a 5-block residual concatenation
  projection ⇒ cross-card handoff is required (residuals bit-identical across
  cards; only shard 0 captured). The candidate selector reads the full-vocab
  codebook directly (~254 MiB) and must stay whole. Do not re-investigate.
  (worklog L3757–3762; PLAN §3.4)
- **`--spec dflash` (v1) is rejected at construction time** — product decision;
  DFlash2 and MTP are the only supported draft backends. (worklog L3717)
- **`--chat-template` is now a generic Jinja interpreter (this entry is
  superseded).** As of the first-tier cherry-pick (`b9219f3f` import llama-jinja
  + `98dada0e` execute custom jinja, 2026-09-21) the frontend compiles and runs
  arbitrary Jinja via the in-tree `third_party/llama-jinja` runtime, and
  `--chat-template FILE` loads a custom template (verified in source
  2026-09-29). The earlier "hand-written renderer + sha256 whitelist" state
  (worklog L2554–2565) is obsolete.
- **Vision: single-image cap 8,192 tokens**, static shard split (MTP→shard 0,
  vision→shard 1); images above the cap are rejected at request time with a
  pointer to the `[mem] vision` ledger. (worklog L2456)

## Rejected optimizations (measured)

- **FP8 PV (2026-09-27): implemented, passed every quality gate, reverted.** It
  cleared G0-G3 (short-prompt acceptance Δ=+0.29 pp, deep-context Δ=−0.88 pp, both
  within the 30-rep noise) but reached only **1.176×** at the op level against the
  ≥1.3× bar (end-to-end ≈+1.4%, single sample) while widening the fp8 op tolerance
  1.2e-2 → 3.2e-2 (~2× output perturbation). Per the user's pre-authorization it was
  rolled back and the 1.2e-2 gate restored; the full implementation sits at the
  repository root as `PLAN-fp8pv-v1b.patch`. The lasting result is the attribution:
  **barrier stall 4.23 cyc/inst (34.2%) + math pipe throttle 3.12 (25.2%)** ⇒ the
  headroom is in the phase structure, not the PV dtype. (worklog 2026-09-27 archive
  §6; PLAN §2)
- **Cross-tile phase pipelining (2026-09-27): rejected.** G0 confirmed barrier is
  still the second stall on the reverted FP16-PV baseline (3.34 cyc/inst, 26.3%; 97%
  of it after the two block-wide `__syncthreads()`), but both resident-role
  implementations fell to **0.71–0.80×**: the whole PV accumulator is Br×D = 64×256
  fp32 = 16,384 registers = 25% of the SM register file, so moving PV to 8 warps
  doubles acc/thread into the 128-register wall, and a 768-thread variant (24 warps)
  pushes the producer past its working-set wall. The baseline "8 producer ∥ 8 Vdeq →
  16-warp PV" packing is optimal in the 1 block/SM envelope. Closed unless the
  envelope changes (Br=32, or a >100 KB block-level smem budget). (worklog 2026-09-27
  archive §7; PLAN §2)
- **Upstream ninfer-all items closed by measurement (2026-09-26).** Per-device
  `cudaFuncSetAttribute` and the 170-SM hardcoding were fixed (3 sites made
  runtime-derived; two stayed comments only, because the derived value would change
  existing 5090 behavior without a 5060 Ti A/B); item 3a disabling RDC was reverted
  (this tree gained +38 stack-frame functions, opposite to upstream); 5b GDN record
  staging was ported but is Op-level only (−22~27%, unmeasurable end to end); 5a
  small-T tensor-core covers only q4/q5 and does not apply to the TP-2 NVFP4/FP8
  trunks; item 4 (re-quantizing the streamed FP8 tensors to NVFP4/Q4) was dropped by
  user decision. (worklog 2026-09-27 archive §5; PLAN §2, §3.8)
- **Prefill AR∥MMA sub-block pipeline (R12 host-side chunk interleave): ~5%
  slower, rolled back.** That implementation, not the lever: a re-implementation
  with per-sub-block events and a dedicated collective stream nets **+11%**
  (see the L2 entry below). R12's stated reason — the in-kernel AR spin is
  "already masked by the peer's compute" — was also contradicted by the
  2026-09-26 divisor arm (AR is 48% of block time and strictly serial).
  (worklog L1425–1468)
- **Multi-block AR: no difference** (TTFT 859/877/879/879/830/861 ms for
  1/2/4/8/16 blocks) — not a single-SM issue. (worklog L653–655)
- **Copy-engine rendezvous (small payloads): slower (951 vs 857 ms) and shard
  logits disagree** — rendezvous/double-buffer semantics do not hold. (worklog
  L655–656)
- **Large-payload event path (Phase 3): rejected.** Copy-engine floor 3.32 ms vs
  sliced 2.70 ms; the event fence alone is +23%. (worklog L5059, L5114)
- **Copy-engine large-payload arm (design stage): not implemented.** The real
  lever is the 128 calls/round count, not the transfer mechanism; the prefill
  control arm was left untouched and proved it. (worklog L3503)
- **GQA-aware prompt kernel (L1): falsified at the measurement gate.** ncu on
  the production prompt kernel: DRAM 1.09% (KV traffic absorbed by L2), tensor
  pipeline 63.5% busiest, occupancy locked at 33% (100 regs + ~100 KB smem per
  thread). Warp doubling: −12% (register spilling). Bc 64→128: cannot launch.
  The 6× KV-request redundancy is not a DRAM cost. (worklog L5290, L5344–5365)
- **Reducing AR call count requires giving up weight splitting** ⇒ always a loss
  in decode. The only correct direction is overlap. (worklog L2757–2758)
- **Prefill allreduce is at the hardware floor.** Card 2 sits in a chipset
  Gen4 x4 slot (~7 GB/s) ⇒ 2.67k tok/s ceiling; the measured marginal slope
  (0.368 ms/token) sits exactly on it, independent of chunk width. The largest
  single lever is hardware: move card 2 to a CPU-direct Gen5 x8 slot. (worklog
  L642–659)
- **Overclock/power wall and P2P are infeasible** (already at full clock,
  93/85 W; the consumer driver masks P2P, `canAccessPeer=0`, SYS topology
  across root complexes). (worklog L2543, L5282)
- **Device-plane divergence anchor (+73.4 MiB/card): abandoned.** Saves only
  ~9.9 ms per session; in real chat the reachability guard usually holds and
  the device path is taken. (worklog L1976–1984)

## Upstream merge-value assessments

- **Upstream `origin/master` through `e31bc99b` (2026-09-26) and `origin/dev`
  through `a012e2bc` (2026-09-28): assessed 2026-09-29, no TP-2 merge value.**
  Checked the perf candidates against the settled bottleneck - decode is
  weight-stream bandwidth-bound (GEMV 75-90%, lm_head ~439 GB/s ≈ 5060 Ti peak;
  36 SM, worklog L7360):
  - *Linear unification + sliced-K MMA* (09-26 batch `229c1832`…`ecbc3357`): no
    gain. Sliced-K does not cut weight traffic on a bandwidth-bound GEMM; the
    NVFP4 trunk is W4A4 while upstream's sliced-K targets the A16 route
    (upstream deleted W4A4); TP-2 half-geometry halves N (column-parallel) or K
    (row-parallel), shrinking the split-K space.
  - *nvfp4 W4A4 TMA tweaks* (`1d8587bc`/`05507ab0`/`5f5fccab`): already
    cherry-picked (second tier) but no TP-2 gain - every main GEMM is a
    half-geometry shape that runs the MMA route, never TMA (all 5 half shapes
    lack `nvfp4_a4_tma_route`; only the 5 full-geometry shapes have it).
  - *q4/q5 dispatch tuning* (`d3c125ed`/`beedffa0`/`bb844c43`/`a9a0d10a`/
    `b39de4d5`/`9e163eee`/`5b4303c0`/`594930e7`): not on the trunk (mainline is
    NVFP4; q4/q5 only in the DFlash2 draft path, also bandwidth-bound). Already
    "not scheduled" (worklog L4357).
  - *Custom Jinja chat templates* (`98dada0e` + `b9219f3f`): a feature, not a
    perf lever - already merged (first tier) with local extensions;
    `--chat-template FILE` runs via the in-tree `third_party/llama-jinja`
    runtime. Nothing to merge.
  Real levers remain those in worklog/PLAN (allreduce, AR∥MMA overlap N=4, CUDA
  graph, card-2 Gen5 slot). Re-assess only if `origin/master` moves past
  `e31bc99b` in a way that touches the trunk. (source-verified 2026-09-29)

- **Upstream `origin/master` = `origin/dev` = `68c54356` (2026-10-05): the
  cache-boundary trimming fix is ported; the rest is still reference-only.**
  Re-assessed 2026-10-05 after the baseline moved (73 upstream commits from the
  `e360c4c0` merge base, 270 local ones).
  - *Ported - `68c54356` "fix(frontend): preserve cache boundaries through
    template trimming".* A source byte range collapsed by `trim`/`strip` is now
    retained through string composition (`string_part::collapsed_source_end`,
    `cut_bytes(begin, end, collapse_removed)`, `append_boundary`), published as
    `TemplateOutput::boundary_mappings`, and consulted by `source_boundary`.
    Before it, every trimmed part lost its `source_offset`, so
    `MessagePartBoundary` and `LeadingInstructionBoundary` markers resolved to
    nothing and `prepare_context_cache` dropped them silently (`if (!resolved)
    continue`). That is the common case, not an edge case: the production
    templates (`tools/chat_templates/qwen3_{6,8}.jinja`) apply `|trim` to every
    message's rendered content and to `reasoning_content`, so a system block or
    `tool_result` ending in a newline lost its requested frontier - the caller's
    `cache_control` had no effect and the span was re-prefilled. Genuinely
    ambiguous frontiers (repeated text, non-exact transforms, slice endpoints)
    still resolve to no boundary, and a boundary landing inside one BPE token is
    still rejected, so a wrong-frontier reuse is not introduced. Local
    deviations: `strip()` keeps the local manual Unicode trim (upstream
    `a8e212ac`'s `trim_utf8` refactor is a separate item), `value.cpp` keeps the
    local `_WIN32` `localtime_s` branch, and the continuation truncation in
    `chat_template.cpp` also drops collapsed boundaries that fall past the
    retained end (upstream leaves the new vector unclamped while
    `Tokenizer::encode_with_boundaries` rejects a byte boundary beyond the text
    outright). Evidence: upstream's 20-case regression (Unicode spaces, macros,
    slices, `tojson`, an injected BPE merge `x`+`y`) added to
    `test_frontend.cpp` plus three `boundary_mappings` assertions in
    `test_jinja.cpp`; 13 of the 14 resolvable cases fail without the fix, and
    `ninfer_jinja_test` / `ninfer_qwen3_5_frontend_test` /
    `ninfer_prompt_input_test` / the OpenAI+Anthropic schema tests /
    `ninfer_prepare_ragged_prefix_test` pass with it. `ninfer_chat_templates_test`
    fails on its recorded host-side cause (worklog L7396), identically before and
    after the port.
  - *Ported - `75a89050` "fix(runtime): wait for compute before request cleanup".*
    `ProgramImpl::abort` and the `start_request` rollback returned the lane's
    buffers, pages and execution row to the pools without waiting for the compute
    stream, so a cancel that arrived after activation but before the first prefill
    unit had waited for its uploads and initialization could free memory an
    in-flight kernel was still writing. Local placement differs from upstream in
    one respect: the sync sits before `retain_aborted_continuation`, because
    catalogueing the aborted continuation reads the same device buffers and
    upstream has no retention branch at that point. The same class was audited and
    closed on the production route: `TP2GenerationCore::drive_lane_queue`'s
    whole-batch failure path returns every lane's KV pages right after a round
    that threw, and a stalled collective only leaves its kernel on the bounded
    in-kernel expiry, so both shard streams now drain before the pages go back. No
    sync is needed at the other release sites: `finish` is reachable only from
    `Lifecycle::Finishable` (set after the round's host-visible results were
    consumed), `commit`'s cancelled row only bumps the lane revision while the
    release happens in `finish`/`abort`, the materialization abort settles the
    transfer stream through `context_completion_` under the same open context
    transaction (so admission cannot interleave before the upload completes), and
    `fail_all_cleanup` runs on the terminal `failed_` path where the pool is never
    handed out again. Evidence: full build; `ninfer_qwen3_5_tp2_lanes_test`
    (2xRTX 5060 Ti, `NINFER_TEST_ARTIFACT=D:/LLM/qwen3_8_27b_swift15_dflash2_final.ninfer`,
    five scenarios including queued cancellation and a driver stop with a request
    in flight) and `ninfer_tp_device_pair_test` (in-kernel AR stall/give-up) exit
    0, the materialization/resource-manager/engine-options/HTTP host tests pass,
    and the frontend/jinja suites still pass. No deterministic reproduction of the
    in-flight cancel race exists; the change is an ordering guarantee on a path
    that is otherwise rare.
  - *Everything else on the trunk remains reference-only.* `b9114396` replaces
    the context cache and adds preemptive scheduling (176 files), a different
    product contract; the SM-count refactor
    (`a667efdd`/`417eb3d6`/`e621c7d6`) reaches this fork only as the
    `device_sm_count()` numeric policy (rope/rmsnorm done 2026-09-26; the MoE
    prefill grid cap and the attention split budgets still need a 5060 Ti A/B);
    the attention/linear perf batch (`23b0997d`…`7f6aafed`) is half-geometry MMA
    under the same no-gain argument as the 2026-09-29 assessment; `1cfdb4d6`/
    `84cf93e4` are no-ops at the local CUDA 13.1 toolchain. Inventory in PLAN.md
    3.8. (source-verified 2026-10-05)

## Withdrawn approaches (falsified by real traffic)

- **"Continuation boundary" (reuse to the end of the last generation):
  withdrawn.** DSH re-renders the assistant turn instead of echoing the
  generated token stream; the continuation slot was used 0/36 in real traffic.
  (worklog L1495–1510)
- **Template `|trim` → `rstrip('\n')`: rolled back.** Even with a maintained
  override template, verbatim replay of `reasoning_content` still stops at the
  previous prompt length. (worklog L5405–5406)
- **Text-protocol replay cannot guarantee token-exact reproduction.** The first
  generated token is not in the published reasoning text (`max_tokens=1` ⇒
  empty `reasoning_content`); with the DFlash2 cost gate (decline draft ≈ 3×
  decode vs saved prefill), recomputing is the rational choice. The only lever
  for token-exact reuse is a continuation protocol carrying token ids
  (unscheduled). (worklog L5408–5413, L5457)

  *Byte-exactness withdrawn; the generated span is adopted instead.* The
  template's `|trim` removes the leading whitespace of the model's reasoning
  (worklog L5389–5391), so a replayed turn parts from the resident history at
  its first token while describing the same turn. When the two renderings agree
  - same trimmed reasoning, same trimmed content, byte-identical tool-call
  region - the walk replaces the replay with the tokens this lineage generated
  and reaches its frontier again; a replay that describes a different turn keeps
  the old fall-back, and decode now writes the checkpoint grid so that fall-back
  costs at most one stride. `turn_replay.h` owns the guard,
  `adopt_generated_turn` the replacement, and `NINFER_TP2_REUSE_TRACE=1`
  reports `adopted=` and the divergence bytes per request.
- **"Unaligned reuse must decline the masked draft": premise overturned.** Same
  round: declining 22.5 vs keeping 87.1 tok/s with near-identical acceptance ⇒
  the gate, `draft_context_declined`, `reuse_grid` and session-mean pricing
  were removed; a single scan with the deepest boundary wins. (worklog
  L4251–4279 background)
- **DFlash2 TP-2 option (b) (2026-09-22): implemented, then rolled back.** It
  was not the cause of the solo-probe instability; the route went back to
  construction-time rejection until the clamping-round root cause was fixed
  (B5). (worklog L3974–3978)

## Measurement and methodology rules

- **Acceptance-rate verdicts need a 30-rep pool.** The 15-rep inter-arm noise
  floor is ~±2 pp; two "−2 pp cost" verdicts from 15-rep pools were later shown
  to be noise. (worklog L6200–6206)
- **Greedy cross-arm comparison is invalid.** Draft proposal length changes the
  verify batch shape ⇒ target numerics change ⇒ text drifts (6/7 probe prompts
  differ). Greedy probes are deterministic regression checks only; pooled
  sampling is the acceptance-rate statistic. (worklog L5788–5793)
- **`CUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING=1` / compute-sanitizer are incompatible with the
  TP-2 in-kernel AR** — the A-side launch becomes blocking, the B-side kernel
  waits for it ⇒ the first collective always gives up (self-deadlock).
  Kernel-level attribution requires source-level probe bisection. (worklog
  L6431–6433)
- **Boundary sensitivity:** the last chunk width is not the variable; the
  boundary position is; 120-step decode shows zero flips. (worklog L3587)
- **B7 (verify graph) settling needs ≥24 reps/arm.** Current A/B: 6 reps/arm,
  aggregate +5.2%, per-request t=0.99 (not significant). (PLAN §3.4)
- **The Q4 selector uses coarse T buckets, not per-T capacity buckets** —
  per-T instantiation is pure code bloat under the mask path. (worklog
  L5709–5712)
- **Draft-quantization overrides are cumulative by design** — each arm must be
  the cumulative artifact, otherwise it falls back to the official Q8 recipe
  and the test is not of the product path. (worklog L5719–5721)

## Root causes (settled)

- **MTP consistency (①): shards never wrote replay records** (fold consumed an
  empty log). Fixed; criteria were no-regression + same quality tier + speedup.
  (worklog L1255)
- **Spin hang (2026-09-23): token counter cross-card false sharing.** Fixed;
  `DevicePair::start_ar_watchdog` retained as a diagnostic. (worklog L4648)
- **Clamping rounds: `forward_tp2_window` never bound
  `active_valid_columns_` / `valid_columns`** ⇒ paged-KV same-slot tearing.
  Fixed. (worklog L4137, L4816)
- **DFlash2 22 tok/s: the decline guard misfired on the template prefix**
  (~37–57 tokens always hit the unaligned fallback ⇒ `extent=0` every round).
  Fixed with a 16×-budget cost gate. (worklog L4251–4279)
- **TP-2 decode double preview:** `preview_model` already handles termination;
  the decode loop was publishing a second preview. (worklog L395–396)
- **Early GDN test failures: test bug** (GDN state pool not reset between the
  card-local double forwards). (worklog L335)
- **Bounded-spin give-up inside a captured window:** the round keeps running
  with locally-only partial sums; the window's kernels consume the inconsistent
  data as addresses ⇒ illegal address; no host-side check can make it in time.
  Only eager-prefill give-ups become clean 503s. Mitigations in place:
  abandon-output (1b), watchdog (default on), timeout default 2000→10,000 ms
  (a second-level stall is a host/driver event, not a slow kernel). (worklog
  L6436–6441, L6472–6481; PLAN §3.6)
- **Two low-frequency failures (r67 IllegalAddress req#14; r69 HTTP 503
  req#14) are the same event class.** Natural rate ≲1/1,500 requests; long runs
  (1,500 requests, watchdog on) have not caught the trigger. (PLAN §3.3, §3.6)
- **The two low-frequency transport failures are a one-collective rendezvous skew
  (settled 2026-10-06).** The in-kernel allreduce published one id per slice and spun
  until the peer's slot equalled it, while the engine legitimately lets the mirror shard
  run a call or two behind (only shard A is drained where a round reads its sample), so
  whenever the fast side completed a collective and published the next one before the
  slow side sampled, the wait became unsatisfiable and the 10 s bound turned it into the
  usual 503. The natural dumps pin it: arrival slot 0 differs by exactly one id between
  A and B with every other slot identical, and `last=352` - the `dflash_selector_tp2`
  back exchange payload (`align16(5*4 + 16*5*4)`) - i.e. two `sendrecv`s with no
  device work between them, the tightest handoff the transport ever sees. Fixed by
  banking the arrival and write-order slots and rotating the bank with the id
  (`NINFER_TP2_AR_BANKS`, power of two in 1..8, default 4; 1 is the pre-bank geometry),
  so the bank still holds the id the slow side is waiting for. Acceptance: the
  `check_ar_skew` case in `ninfer_tp_device_pair_test` (hold injection: 1 bank must
  still give up, 4 banks must complete bit exact) and
  `tools/tp_bootstrap/r89_skew_acceptance.ps1` (1 bank must fail - the warmup with a stall
  message or a request with 503 and a watchdog dump - and 4 banks must start and serve).
  Injection: `NINFER_TP2_AR_FAULT_HOLD_POLL=<eager serial>:<ns>[:self]` (0 = every eager
  collective; captures are excluded, since a hold recorded into a captured graph would be
  replayed by every launch of it); both fault hooks log `[ar-fault]` when they land.
  (device_pair.{h,cu}; worklog §3.10)
- **BF16-add allreduce is bit-safe only for BF16 payloads.** I32/FP32 ids can
  carry signaling-NaN bit patterns; use `DevicePair::sendrecv` for byte-exact
  cross-card exchange. DFlash2's equivalent paths are fixed; the MTP route at
  `execution/text.cpp:486` is not (verification cost high). (PLAN §3.3)
- **Official NVFP4 artifact's lower acceptance rate vs synthetic/self-
  converted:** the difference is in the text weights, not the components.
  (worklog 2026-09-27 archive)
- **Solo-probe determinism: ~6% flip rate** refutes "byte-identical across
  runs" for the dflash2 solo probe. (worklog L4097)
- **The sessions plain-route failure is pre-existing** (the r57 baseline
  artifact reproduces it token-exactly; dflash2/mtp routes pass) ⇒ blocks the
  three-suite all-green; the sessions gate runs on the dflash2 route. (worklog
  L5811–5815; PLAN §3.3)

## Tool and environment boundaries

- **WSL2 CUDA is unusable for execution** (PTX JIT segfault in
  `cudaGetDeviceCount()`; GPU held by Windows services) ⇒ the WSL tree is
  compile-verification only; all tests run on the Windows side
  (`tools/win_port/test.ps1`). (PLAN §3.5)
- **Three GPUs visible:** nvidia-smi order 0/2 = 5060 Ti, 1 = Tesla T10;
  `--devices 0,1` picks the two 5060 Tis by CUDA ordinal (offset from
  nvidia-smi order). (PLAN §1)
- **Windows PATH must include the FFmpeg and libcurl `bin` dirs** or
  solo/sessions die at load with `0xC0000135` (append does not use the media
  path). (PLAN §1)
- **Windows libcurl link:** `find_library` picks the static `libcurl.a`
  (MSVC cannot link it); prefer `find_file(... libcurl.dll.a)`. (worklog
  L2680)
- **Process discipline:** one model process machine-wide (WSL 8088 vs Windows
  8099 mutually exclusive); stop the service before relinking the exe
  (LNK1104); `build-win/apps/ninfer-serve.exe` is not auto-synced to
  `C:\ninfer\`. (PLAN §1)
- **Watchdog cost model:** `note_ar_call` was already unconditional; the
  thread polls host counters every 25 ms, calls no CUDA API, touches no
  stream; large dumps are rate-limited to one per stall. A/B: no measurable
  cost. (worklog L6485–6492)
- **The frontend test fixture rejection is a pre-existing failure** (fixture
  template rejected by the chat-template whitelist; expected to turn green
  after the cherry-pick). (worklog L4321)

## Deferred (settled as "not now")

- **Full draft NVFP4: not advancing** (source-level audit;
  [tp2-dflash2-draft-nvfp4.md](tp2-dflash2-draft-nvfp4.md)). Only ~202.3 MiB
  left vs r66 q4all, of which 174.3 MiB is the non-GEMM codebook; NVFP4
  0.5625 B/elem > Q4 0.53125 B/elem, so re-quantizing already-Q4 tensors would
  grow them; three hard blockers (no float→NVFP4 quantizer in the converter and
  no A4 activation calibration for the dynamic-FP8 draft source; NVFP4 native
  Weight only takes full parents; consumer op NVFP4 geometries are closed
  sets). Reopen only with a W4A4-family / prefill-TMA motivation. (worklog
  L6053–6060)
- **Ring K/V quantization (CyclicKVCache): deferred.** Locked in three places
  (`CyclicKVCache` layout, SWA validation, `context_kv_materialize`
  `validate_cache`); ~55 MiB, worst cost/benefit. (worklog L5534)
- **L2 (AR∥MMA overlap): retested with a corrected schedule; +11% prefill.**
  The prefill chunk is split into N 64-aligned sub-blocks and each sub-block's
  collective runs on a second stream (`DeviceContext::collective_stream`) while
  the next sub-block's mixer/FFN keeps the compute stream busy
  (`run_layers_tp2_overlap`, `--prefill-overlap W` / `EngineOptions::prefill_overlap`,
  default 256, `0` disables). Chunk 1024, ~6.3k-token prompt, 7 reps (median): N=0 0.587 ms/token, N=2
  0.554, **N=3 0.612 (slower than doing nothing)**, **N=4 0.516 (−12%,
  reproduced across two batches)**, N=5 0.547, N=8 0.655. N=4 (256-wide
  sub-blocks) is the real optimum, and **N does not interpolate** — 320/384
  falls into a slower activation/MMA schedule class — so a policy must key on
  the 256-token sub-block width, not extrapolate N. Re-verified at chunk 512:
  0.625 serial → 0.572 with 256-wide sub-blocks (−8.4%). Bit-identical to the
  single-block loop (tp2_forward_test chunk-split invariant exact at N=2 and
  N=4). This supersedes R12's −5% and the "unscheduled" status. (worklog L5291
  + the two 2026-09-27 entries)
- **Gate revision (sampling-led acceptance verdict): separate from the
  promotion.** The literal greedy gate `|Δacc| ≤ 1.0pp` failed at K=7
  (−1.60 pp, proven cross-arm text drift); the promotion is done (r69,
  user-confirmed); 30-rep pooled sampling is the de facto method. Formalize in
  one place if/when. (worklog L5826; PLAN §3.4)
- **Genuinely open items** (tracked in PLAN §3, not settled): bf16 KV + MTP
  first-prefill crash; MTP I32 sNaN risk; MTP3 ≥70 tok/s; perplexity on TP-2;
  trigger source of the low-frequency transport failures; B7 settling
  (≥24 reps/arm); sessions plain-route failure; upstream 3b/3c and the 5060 Ti
  SM-count A/B timings (PLAN §3.8).
