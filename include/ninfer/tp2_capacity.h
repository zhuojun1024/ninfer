// The core drives its own round loop on the `--devices a,b` route, so it - not the Engine - is the
// authority on how many requests that route can execute at once. Both `normalize_engine_options`
// (runtime/engine/model_instance.cpp) and the service layer's `effective_request_capacity`
// (serve/serve_options.cpp) read this one constant, because the capacity the service accepts and the
// capacity the core actually executes must not drift apart; that drift was the P6 defect the
// service/engine capacity mirror was introduced to fix.
//
// Phase 1 raises this constant as the core gains per-lane batch decode:
//   1 -> single request at a time
//   4 -> the Phase 1 target (C<=4, shared KV pool, no cross-session retention)
// The operator opts into more than one lane with --max-concurrency; the default of 1 keeps the
// historical one-request-at-a-time behaviour.

// round the same shape. `--spec dflash` has no TP-2 context layout at all (the engine rejects it), so
// it is the only speculative backend that collapses rather than feeding every lane through row 0.
// Keeping that rule beside the ceiling means the capacity the service admits and the capacity the
