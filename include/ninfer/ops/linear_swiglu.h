 * Op: linear_swiglu
 *
 * Math / indexing:
 *   gate_up = Linear(x, gate_up_weight); M=gate_up_rows/2;
 *   ideal[i,t] = SiLU(gate_up[i,t]) * gate_up[M+i,t].
 *
 * Logical shapes / supported domain:
 *   T may be any positive value. The registered profiles are:
 *   - Q4_G64_FP16 weight [34816,5120], x [5120,T], out [17408,T];
 *   - Q8_G32_FP16 weight [12288,2048], x [2048,T], out [6144,T];
 *   - Q8_G32_FP16 weight [34816,5120], x [5120,T], out [17408,T];
 *   - NVFP4 BlockScaleK16M128x4 weight [34816,5120], x [5120,T], out [17408,T];
 *   - FP8_E4M3FN_ROW_BF16 RowScale weight [34816,5120], x [5120,T], out [17408,T].
 *   Inputs and output are contiguous BF16. Q4/Q8 scales are FP16, NVFP4 scales are E4M3FN, and
 *   row-scaled FP8 has one BF16 multiplier per gate/up parent row. Gate rows `[0,17408)` precede
 *   their matching up rows `[17408,34816)`.
 *
 * Numeric:
 *   The oracle exact-decodes the registered weight and evaluates `ideal` naively in FP64 from the
 *   represented inputs. The BF16 output is promoted and compared directly with that result; output
 *   storage rounding belongs to LinearSwiGLU's named activation-compute criterion, not the oracle.
 *   Production routes may fuse or materialize gate/up and may choose their natural accumulator,
 *   staging, and workspace precision; those private choices are not semantic rounding boundaries.
 *   AllowA8/AllowA4 permit FP8 activation quantization; route thresholds are implementation
 * choices.
 *
 * Effects:
 *   Writes the full output; x/weight and output must not alias.
 *
 * Workspace:
 *   Caller-owned transient storage reported by linear_swiglu_workspace_capacity_bytes(),
 *   scoped to the call. Q8, NVFP4 A16, and row-scaled FP8 A16 require zero bytes; A4/A8 routes use
 *   caller-owned activation storage and may use private projection storage. There is no persistent
 *   state side effect.
