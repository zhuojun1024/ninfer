 *
 *     inv[i,b] = rsqrt(sum_h residual[h,i,b]^2 / H + eps)
 *     n[h,i,b] = residual[h,i,b] * inv[i,b] * norm_weight[h]
 *     row(s,t,g) = (s*2+t)*G+g
 *     d[s,t,g,i,b] = sum_h kernel_projection_weight[row(s,t,g),h] * n[h,i,b]
 *
 *     prepared[h,i,b] =
 *         (base_kernel[h,0,0] + d[0,0,g,i,b]) * n[h,i,b]
 *       + I(i>0) * (base_kernel[h,1,0] + d[0,1,g,i,b]) * n[h,i-1,b]
 *
 *     finish_delta[g,t,i,b] = d[1,t,g,i,b].
 *
 * Logical shapes / supported domain:
 *   residual/prepared are contiguous BF16 [5120,W,B], W is in [2,16] and B in [1,8];
 *   norm_weight is contiguous BF16 [5120]. base_kernel is the runtime view BF16 [5120,2,2] with
 * axes [channel,tap,side]; kernel_projection_weight is contiguous BF16 [1280,5120]; and
 *   finish_delta is contiguous BF16 [320,2,W,B]. eps is positive and finite. Position zero has
 *   no previous-tap contribution: the Op never reads another request or an earlier round.
 *
 * Numeric:
 *   The oracle evaluates the complete formula naively in FP64 from the represented BF16 inputs.
 *   Both BF16 outputs are promoted and compared directly with those ideal values under their
 *   named reduction criteria. RMS reduction order, Tensor Core operand staging, projection
 *   factorization, split-K reduction, and private intermediate precision are implementation
 *   choices; neither n nor the input-side coefficient plane is an observable cast boundary.
 *
 * Effects:
 *   Writes every element of prepared and finish_delta and preserves every input. Inputs, the
 *   weight payload, both outputs, and live workspace must be pairwise non-overlapping. The Op has
 *   no persistent state side effect.
 *
 * Workspace:
 *   Caller-owned call-scoped storage sized by the capacity query above. The implementation does
 *   not allocate or retain device memory.
