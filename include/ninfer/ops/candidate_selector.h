/**
 * Op: candidate_selector_path
 *
 * For K in [1,15] and B in [1,8], the inputs are contiguous candidate_ids I32 [16,K,B],
 * unary_scores FP32 [16,K,B], projected_hidden BF16 [256,K,B], anchors I32 [B],
 * predecessor_codebook and successor_codebook BF16 [256,248320], base_positions I32 [B], and a
 * device-resident SamplingConfig[B]. Candidate rank is the fastest axis. The 16 candidate ids in
 * each row are distinct, and all candidate and anchor token ids lie in [0,248077); the registered
 * vocabulary, artifact binding, and linear_topk producer establish that trusted value contract.
 *
 * Starting with predecessor=anchors[b], each position i in [0,K) computes:
 *
 *   edge[c] = unary_scores[c,i,b]
 *           + sum_r predecessor_codebook[r,predecessor]
 *                   * projected_hidden[r,i,b]
 *                   * successor_codebook[r,candidate_ids[c,i,b]].
 *
 * A row with configs[b].temperature<=0 selects the lowest candidate rank attaining max(edge) and
 * writes its exact one-hot distribution. A positive-temperature row writes the FP32 softmax of
 * edge/temperature, then draws a candidate with counter key
 * (configs[b].seed,base_positions[b]+i,kSamplePurposeDFlash2Proposal). The selected global id is
 * written to drafts[i,b] and becomes the next predecessor. The Op ignores all other
 * SamplingConfig fields and never updates token_counts.
 *
 * drafts is contiguous I32 [K,B] and proposal_q is contiguous FP32 [16,K,B]. Both outputs are
 * completely overwritten. Inputs, outputs, codebooks, and the config array must be pairwise
 * non-overlapping. The Op has no persistent state or internal allocation. Caller workspace is
 * transient and must not overlap any input or output.
