 *   z [6144,T]. T may be any positive value. x, qkv, and z are contiguous BF16.
 *   qk_weight is Q4_G64_FP16 RowSplit [4096,5120] and value_z_weight is one
 *   Q5_G64_FP16 RowSplit parent [12288,5120] in [value,z] row order, both with FP16 scales.

 *   The oracle exact-decodes both weight parents and evaluates all four logical projections
 *   naively in FP64 from the represented input. The BF16 qkv and z outputs are promoted and
 *   compared directly with those ideal values; final output storage rounding belongs to
 *   GdnInputProj's named A16 criterion, not the oracle. Production routes may choose their
 *   private precision independently; every registered route writes both final allocations.

 * Single-parent GDN projection. Registered parent forms are:

 * - Q8_G32_FP16 RowSplit [12288,2048], with stored row counts [2048,2048,4096,4096];

 * - FP8_E4M3FN_ROW_BF16 RowScale [16384,5120], with stored row counts
 *   [2048,2048,6144,6144].
 *
 * The first three ranges are written contiguously to qkv and the final range is written to z.
 * Q8 uses A16 under every policy. NVFP4 uses A16 under A16Only/AllowA8; AllowA4 permits
 * private activation quantization at every positive T. FP8 accepts all policies; AllowA8/AllowA4
 * selects A16 through T=7 and private activation quantization followed by A8 Tensor Core
 * contraction at every T>=8. Every route writes the two independent final allocations directly.
 * The complete projection is evaluated against the same exact-decode/naive-FP64 oracle;
 * activation quantization and the production reduction profile are private effects covered by the
 * selected criterion. x, both persistent weight planes, qkv, z, and the live workspace must be
 * mutually non-overlapping.
 *
 * The policy-bearing form uses caller-owned call-scoped transient storage sized by
 * gdn_input_proj_workspace_capacity_bytes(). A16 requires zero bytes. The convenience overload
 * selects A16Only and requires no transient workspace.

 *
 * Math / indexing:

 *   by initial_state_slots[b], evaluate the width-four depthwise convolution over p, apply SiLU,
 *   and publish its channel ranges to query, key, and value. After valid column j, write the new
 *   width-three history to snapshot_base_slots[b]+j. Z bypasses convolution.

 * Logical shapes:
 *   The 27B registered form has x [5120,W,B], Q4 q/k weight [4096,5120], one Q5 value/z parent

 *   rounding belongs to the Op's named A16 criterion, not the oracle. Former unfused projection
 *   tensors are not observable cast boundaries; production routes use their natural private
 *   accumulator and staging precision. This two-parent Q4/Q5 form does not quantize activation;
 *   the single-parent policy-bearing form below defines its own permitted compute profiles.
 *
 * Effects:
 *   Each row writes query/key/value through its valid prefix and exact zero to its invalid tail;
 *   z is projected for all B*W safe input columns. A row writes only its valid destination state
 *   prefix. The caller reserves disjoint complete [base,base+W) intervals, prevents one row from
 *   overwriting another row's initial slot, and may overlap a row's own initial slot with its
 *   destination after that initial history has been loaded. Other slots are unchanged. Newly
 *   projected convolution channels remain private to the call while published snapshots are BF16.
