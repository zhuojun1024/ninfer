 *
 * Logical shapes:
 *   positions is a contiguous I32 vector [T].
 *
 * Numeric:
 *   T and stride are positive, start is nonnegative, and start + (T-1) * stride must not exceed
 *   INT32_MAX. Thus every emitted value is a nonnegative I32 position. Stride one emits consecutive
 *   positions; a larger stride lays out disjoint reservation windows of that width.
 *
 * Effects:
 *   Writes the full positions vector.
 *
 * Workspace:
 *   None. The Op has no other state side effect.
