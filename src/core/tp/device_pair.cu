// token and spin (with __nanosleep) until the peer's token matches; phase 3
// reads the peer's buffer and writes the elementwise sum back in place.
// Cross-GPU synchronization happens entirely inside the kernel via the
// host-memory arrival tokens, so the host never calls cudaStreamSynchronize.
// The token is a monotonically increasing call number (never reset), so a stale
// token from a previous call can never satisfy the spin.
//
// A batched prefill all-reduces a [hidden, T] delta (megabytes), so the payload is moved in
// 16-byte groups when every pointer is group-aligned ('groups' is then count/8, zero otherwise and
// the scalar loops below cover the whole payload). Phase 3 reads four groups per thread per step
// because a dependent single-group loop over a mapped host buffer is latency-bound long before it
// is bandwidth-bound: the four loads issue before any of them is consumed.
//
// Slices: a decode-sized payload rides a single block, because its cost is the peer round trip, not
// the transfer. A prefill-sized payload is split over several blocks, each owning one contiguous
// slice and one arrival slot, so the slices reduce independently once their data has landed. On
// this host the payload's device link (device 1 sits behind a Gen4 x4 chipset link, ~7.9 GB/s in
// both directions combined) is the limit, and moving a slice out of the write queue early is what
// lets the peer read it while the remaining slices are still going out: see ar_slices. Block b
// additionally waits for its predecessor's slice to become system-visible before it writes, so the
// slices land in index order instead of interleaving into one long drain.
// block.b write order chain: block b only starts writing once block b-1 published its arrival, so
// each slice becomes system-visible in index order and the peer can read early slices while later
// ones are still in flight. Without it the concurrent writes interleave and no slice is complete
// until the whole transfer drains.
// The arrival token is read from device memory rather than passed by value: a CUDA Graph records
// kernel arguments, so a value-baked token would be replayed unchanged and a peer that is a call
// ahead would satisfy its spin from the previous replay. A device counter that every replay
// increments on both devices keeps the monotonic-token invariant inside a captured sequence.
// kAdd selects the reduction: true is the in-place all-reduce the TP-2 routes run, false is a
// byte-exact exchange where `out` receives the peer's staged bytes unchanged. Both share the
// staging, arrival-token and slice machinery; only phase 3 differs. The copy mode preserves every
// 16-bit lane, so a payload whose lanes spell a signaling NaN - an I32 id, an FP32 score - travels
// intact where the BF16 add would quiet it.
// Rendezvous ids are host-authored (see DevicePair::create_ar_channel): the base cell is written
// before the launch, a captured graph reading it through its own memcpy node and an eager call
// through the host's mapped cell. The ordinal within the block is baked at capture, where it is a
// constant of the graph. Ids therefore only ever increase and are never reused, which is what lets
// the arrival slots be compared for equality at all: a reused id would let a stale slot satisfy the
// spin before the peer wrote anything.
