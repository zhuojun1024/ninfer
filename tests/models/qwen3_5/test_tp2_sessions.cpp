// TP-2 cross-session KV retention.
//
// The device KV pool holds one conversation at a time, so a request that belongs to another one
// evicts the resident session into pinned host memory and copies the returning session back. This
// test drives several alternating conversations through the public Engine route and checks the
// observable consequences: a returning conversation is recalled rather than prefilled
// (reused_prompt_tokens), its output is checked against a from-scratch prefill of the same prompt,
// and a conversation the LRU budget evicted is prefilled from zero again.
//
// A second scenario covers clients that render one stable system prompt ahead of every
// conversation: the two prompts share a long prefix while belonging to different conversations, and
// switching between them has to move the outgoing conversation into its host slabs even though a
// prefix-reuse checkpoint inside the shared prefix is reusable. It also covers the third
// conversation of that family arriving after a small unrelated request has taken over the device
// pools, when only the state frozen at the boundary the family diverged at can carry the restart.
// A fourth scenario covers the return trip of a client that re-renders the answer it was handed:
// the divergence sits at the first generated token, so the conversation has to come back on the
// state frozen at its own prompt end. A last one cancels a prompt mid-prefill and checks that the
// retry continues from the prefix the cancelled walk published, and the one before it forces a
// recall onto a shallow shared-prefix image and checks that the walk freezes where the stable block
// really ends on that conversation's slabs, so the next conversation of the family comes back
// there. One more drops the client's connection mid-answer and checks that the failure costs the
// request, not the conversation: the turn after it still starts at the prompt end the failed walk
// published instead of prefilling the whole history again.
//
// The from-scratch comparison is the strong claim: a reuse that changes the answer must not hide
// behind a matching token count. Every recall that keeps the oracle's draft pattern - the switch
// scenario, the cancellation retry, DFlash2 on the prefill grid, and a shallow mid-chunk recall the
// masked draft rounds back down to that grid - agrees token for token. A recall whose masked draft is
// declined runs target-only rounds instead: a different draft pattern,
// so its near ties resolve its own way and only its boundary crossing is pinned (compare_recall).
//
// A conversation that shares no tokens with the resident one is a switch even when nothing else can
// serve it, so these scenarios also pin down what a switch costs when the host slabs are unusable.
//
// The scenario runs on three routes: plain, MTP and DFlash2. MTP keeps its own KV slab on shard 0
// and DFlash2 keeps its masked draft's local context ring there; all three travel through the same
// eviction transaction and the same prefix-reuse checkpoints, and all three run by default.
// NINFER_TEST_ROUTE narrows the run to one route when one needs a focused pass. The oracle in each
// round uses the same speculative configuration with retention disabled.
//
// The artifact is selected with NINFER_TEST_ARTIFACT; two identical sm_120a devices are required.
// Without either, the test skips with exit code 77.
