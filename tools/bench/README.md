# tools/bench

Maintainer orchestration for the public `ninfer_bench` throughput tool, serving corpus/concurrency
runners, and the external Serve TTFT client. Correctness is owned by the affected suites under
[`tests/`](../../tests/README.md).

## External Serve TTFT

[`ttft/README.md`](ttft/README.md) defines the black-box latency benchmark. The measurement runner
uses frozen text/media requests and public streaming protocols without calling Engine. A separate
controller manages the fixed Qwen3.8-27B NVFP4/FP8 Serve profiles and fresh-process isolation.

```bash
python3 tools/bench/run_serve_ttft_campaign.py --campaign resource --samples 5
```

The controller chooses the profile, starts and stops Serve for every sample, runs the external
client, stages the NVFP4 artifact once in `/dev/shm`, stores raw/progress/Serve artifacts below
`profiles/bench/ttft/`, records structured per-request Serve diagnostics, and writes Markdown,
JSON, and CSV summaries. The case catalog, exact profiles, TTFT boundary, and fixture qualification
are documented in the dedicated README.

## Corpus baker

`ninfer_bench` benchmarks prefill at an exact length by slicing the first `P` token ids of a
committed corpus, so the corpus must be real, in-distribution text (not random tokens) and at
least as long as the largest prefill you want to run. `make_bench_corpus.py` bakes that corpus
offline with a local Hugging Face Qwen3.6 tokenizer.

Outputs (committed):

```text
bench/fixtures/bench_corpus.ids            whitespace-separated decimal token ids (exactly --tokens)
bench/fixtures/bench_corpus.manifest.json  tokenizer id, token count, and source description
```

Content sources:

- Built-in curated multi-domain prose (Chinese / English / code / math) — the default. It is
  encoded WITHOUT the chat template or special tokens, then tiled (paragraphs rotated each cycle)
  and truncated to exactly `--tokens`. Repetition only fills length; because prefill/decode
  throughput is token-count / bandwidth bound, it does not bias the numbers.
- `--source-text <file>` (repeatable) — tokenize your own long meaningful text instead, e.g. a
  downloaded public-domain book or a concatenated document set, for genuinely diverse very long
  content. The committed default is `~64k` tokens; raise `--tokens` and/or pass `--source-text`
  for more.

The binary slices `[0:P]`; the manifest is provenance only.

## Requirements

Install the tokenizer dependencies into the active Python environment:

```bash
pip install -r tools/bench/requirements.txt
```

The tokenizer is loaded locally only; the tool never downloads from the network. Pass
`--tokenizer-path` or set `NINFER_TOKENIZER_PATH`.

## Regenerate / check

```bash
# Regenerate the committed corpus from the built-in bank (default 65536 tokens).
python3 tools/bench/make_bench_corpus.py \
  --tokenizer-path /path/to/local/Qwen3.6-27B/tokenizer \
  --tokens 65536

# Bake from your own downloaded/assembled text instead (kept local; not committed).
python3 tools/bench/make_bench_corpus.py \
  --tokenizer-path /path/to/local/Qwen3.6-27B/tokenizer \
  --tokens 131072 --source-text /path/to/book.txt

# Check that the committed .ids and its descriptive manifest agree; no tokenizer or source needed.
python3 tools/bench/make_bench_corpus.py --check
```

`--tokens` is the exact committed corpus size and the ceiling on prefill length; increase it (and
optionally use `--source-text`) to benchmark longer prefills, memory permitting.

## NInfer performance matrix

`run_ninfer_bench_matrix.py` runs the layered public-Engine `ninfer_bench` matrix against the native
`.ninfer` artifact and stores its local reports under `profiles/bench/`. Its defaults are:

```text
artifact: out/qwen3_6_27b.ninfer
binary:   build/bench/ninfer_bench
corpus:   bench/fixtures/bench_corpus.ids
```

The matrix treats MTP `k=3` with the optimized proposal head as the primary path, keeps `k=0` and
`k=5` as controls, and sweeps `k=0..5` on representative context-decode cases. Decode-bearing cases
cover CUDA Graph and eager execution; prefill-only cases vary prompt length and prefill chunk.

```bash
# Configure the benchmark targets once; they are off in the default public build.
cmake -S . -B build -DNINFER_BUILD_BENCHMARKS=ON

# Inspect commands without running the model.
python3 tools/bench/run_ninfer_bench_matrix.py --preset core --dry-run

# Main run. Builds build/bench/ninfer_bench first, then writes JSON and summary.csv.
python3 tools/bench/run_ninfer_bench_matrix.py --preset core

# Longer run that adds 32k/64k prompt and context-decode points.
python3 tools/bench/run_ninfer_bench_matrix.py --preset full

# Run only the MTP draft-window sweep.
python3 tools/bench/run_ninfer_bench_matrix.py --preset full --suite mtp_sweep
```

Default outputs:

```text
profiles/bench/ninfer-<preset>-<timestamp>/
  commands.sh
  manifest.json
  json/<suite>/<case>.json
  logs/<suite>.<case>.stderr.txt
  summary.csv
  summary.json
```

Use `--resume` to skip completed JSON reports in an existing `--output-dir`, and `--preset smoke`
for a minimal script/runner check. `--no-build` uses the binary supplied by `--bench` without
building it.

Each raw report must be `ninfer_bench_report` schema v15. The flattened summary and schema-v4 matrix
manifest carry native facts from the report: architecture, public name, actual formats, prefill signature, artifact,
load/read/upload/staging values, Engine memory arenas including the non-additive Vision layout
inside the unified workspace and CUDA Graph allowance, per-test planned logical and
allocator-observed workspace peaks, KV capacity and
payload, configured proposal head and graph mode, phase timings and throughput, and speculative
rounds/drafts/acceptance/fallbacks. The matrix manifest is descriptive and records the commands and
selected local inputs; it does not make repository state part of report validity.

## Serving corpus benchmark

[Published coverage and model results](../../docs/performance.md) identify the recorded runs.
The [serving methodology](../../docs/performance/methodology.md) owns workload definitions,
metric boundaries, aggregation, comparison rules, and publication format. This section describes
runner usage and output files.

`run_serve_corpus.py` accepts explicit `--artifact LABEL=PATH` entries. Labels identify report groups;
the selected artifact supplies the architecture, public name and weight bindings.
Omitting `--mode` selects MTP0 and MTP3; repeat `--mode` to select a subset. Use `dflash7` for
Qwen3.6-35B-A3B DFlash K=7 and `dflash2_7` for Qwen3.8-27B DFlash2 K=7, with companion weights
in the selected artifact. `--sampling greedy` selects exact argmax; the default is stochastic.
Run commands with a selected Python 3.11 interpreter, as in the model-page reproduction entries.

The serial runner writes `run.jsonl`, `summary.csv`, `summary.md`, and per-server logs under
`server/`. JSONL contains the completed requests and responses; CSV/Markdown contain fixture and
category summaries. The output directory is supplied explicitly with `--output`.

Its schema-v7 result and flattened summaries retain the actual `prefill_signature`, request Host
exposure, and decode Host/Device-wait time per round received from the schema-v21 serving records.
Request exposure is a latency distribution value and is never summed across concurrent requests;
worker aggregation uses the serving `throughput.host_work` interval deltas. The stochastic route pins its complete
temperature/top-p/top-k/min-p/presence/frequency profile explicitly, so model-default changes do
not alter the measurement method.

## Concurrent serving benchmark

`run_serve_concurrency.py` selects `--suite decode-saturation` or `--suite corpus-makespan`.
Their distinct time boundaries and workload dispatch are defined in the
[serving methodology](../../docs/performance/methodology.md#workloads-and-measurement-boundaries).
Repeat `--concurrency` to select C points; each point starts a fresh server. The point report
records the actual Engine configuration, automatic KV capacity, shuffle seed where applicable,
dispatch method, and per-request positions.

Schema-v3 outputs include `points/*.json`, `server/*.jsonl`, and combined `summary.json`, `summary.csv`, and
`summary.md`. Corpus runs also write complete responses in `corpus/<point>/results.jsonl` and
per-request phase summaries in that directory; older campaigns may have only point reports and
server logs. Historical model pages identify the report directory associated with each table.

```bash
python3 tools/bench/run_serve_concurrency.py \
  --artifact qwen3_6_27b=out/qwen3_6_27b_nvfp4.ninfer \
  --mode mtp3 --suite decode-saturation \
  --concurrency 1 --concurrency 2 --concurrency 4 \
  --decode-tokens 8192 \
  --output profiles/bench/concurrent-decode

python3 tools/bench/run_serve_concurrency.py \
  --artifact qwen3_6_27b=out/qwen3_6_27b_nvfp4.ninfer \
  --mode mtp3 --suite corpus-makespan \
  --concurrency 1 --concurrency 2 \
  --output profiles/bench/concurrent-corpus
```

Use `--kv-capacity auto` when the fixed corpus needs more shared KV than the default 262,144-token
pool. A point is intentionally not resumable: combining fragments from separate server processes
would not preserve either a steady interval or one continuous makespan.

## Speculative acceptance A/B

`run_serve_spec_ab.py` replays one fixed fixture and seed plan against one persistent
`ninfer-serve` and records the complete speculative counters from every `request_done` event,
including `accepted_per_position`. Its `compare` subcommand reports the two aggregations the
[serving methodology](../../docs/performance/methodology.md#metrics-and-statistics) keeps apart
(the ratio of summed tokens, and the mean of the per-request ratios), the per-position
decomposition, and the paired per-request difference with a confidence interval.

It is an attribution instrument, not a published workload: hold everything except the changed
dimension equal - draft width, proposal head, sampling profile, concurrency, KV dtype, context
ceiling, build and rendered prompt - then read the paired delta rather than the two pooled rates.

```bash
python3 tools/bench/run_serve_spec_ab.py run \
  --artifact out/baseline.ninfer --label baseline \
  --spec dflash2 --draft-tokens 7 --lm-head-draft \
  --fixture scenario_code_cuda --fixture scenario_structured_jsonl --seeds 5 \
  --pad-chars 140000 --prefix-reuse --outdir profiles/bench/spec-ab-baseline

python3 tools/bench/run_serve_spec_ab.py run \
  --artifact out/candidate.ninfer --label candidate \
  --spec dflash2 --draft-tokens 7 --lm-head-draft \
  --fixture scenario_code_cuda --fixture scenario_structured_jsonl --seeds 5 \
  --pad-chars 140000 --prefix-reuse --outdir profiles/bench/spec-ab-candidate

python3 tools/bench/run_serve_spec_ab.py compare \
  --a profiles/bench/spec-ab-baseline/summary.json \
  --b profiles/bench/spec-ab-candidate/summary.json --label-a baseline --label-b candidate
```

`--fixture` defaults to every scenario fixture, and `--seeds N` takes the first N of the five
campaign seeds so plans stay comparable across runs. `--pad-chars` prepends that many characters
of the `long_niah_64k` document, which is how a deep-context prompt is built without synthetic
filler. `--sampling greedy` measures the proposal against the target's own argmax; the default
stochastic route pins the profile the methodology publishes. `--devices A,B` selects the TP-2
pair and is omitted on a single-device route. `--keep-text` stores response text for stream
comparisons; the default stores only its hash.

Each run directory holds `summary.json` (records plus the resolved server facts), `requests.jsonl`
(the raw server request log), `server_argv.json`, and `server.out.log`/`server.err.log`. A worked
deep-context comparison is in
[tp2-dual-5060ti.md](../../docs/tp2-dual-5060ti.md#draft-precision-and-the-selector-codebooks).
