# Qwen3.8-27B NVFP4 for NInfer

This model card is the version-controlled source for
[neroued/Qwen3.8-27B-nvfp4-NInfer](https://huggingface.co/neroued/Qwen3.8-27B-nvfp4-NInfer).

The repository contains a mixed NVFP4/FP8 representation of
[Qwen3.8-27B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B). It combines the official BF16 checkpoint
with the fixed packed Text weights from
[unsloth/Qwen3.8-27B-NVFP4](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen3.8-27B-NVFP4) in the native
[NInfer](https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer) `.ninfer` artifact format. The artifact is intended
only for NInfer; it is not a Transformers checkpoint, Safetensors distribution, or GGUF file.

The artifact uses the Qwen3.5 Dense architecture. Text layers 0–55 use NVFP4 MLP weights,
while the token embedding, attention input/output
projections, GDN Q/K/V/Z and output projections, full output head, and Text layers 56–63 MLP weights
use row-scaled FP8. Control weights use BF16, with separate MTP, Vision and DFlash2 weights.

## Artifact

| Stored objects | 1,246 (1,240 tensors and 6 resources) |
| NVFP4 tensors | 112 |
| Row-scaled FP8 tensors | 146 |

The file contains Text, Vision, MTP, DFlash2, the optimized proposal head and frontend resources.
Vision and speculative weights are loaded only when selected at startup. Source-derived NVFP4 and
FP8 words are preserved without decode and requantization; only the official BF16 token embedding
is encoded locally as row-scaled FP8.

Verify a downloaded file with:

```bash
printf '%s  %s\n' \

  'qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer' | sha256sum --check
```

This release includes the complete DFlash2 companion weights from
`z-lab/Qwen3.8-27B-DFlash2` at revision
`50307d4c4cde6860d4eee73e2547cd786fe8e8a4`. Select
`--spec dflash2 --draft-tokens 7 --lm-head-draft`; draft counts 1..15 are supported.
DFlash2 requires the runtime revision listed below. Existing performance and evaluation tables
retain their stated MTP configurations and revisions.

## Requirements

- [NInfer](https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer) revision
  [`04350ba9`](https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer/commit/98dada0e03cb073fd07f905400b5904bc6e82759)
  or later, built from source;
- 64-bit Linux or native Windows;
- an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090, or two identical RTX 5060 Ti cards (TP-2, server
  route only);
- CUDA Toolkit 13.1 or newer (Linux), or CUDA 13.3 with Visual Studio 2022 (Windows).

Already have the official v2 file? [Upgrade it locally](https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer/blob/master/docs/weight-conversion.md#upgrade-an-existing-v2-artifact)
without downloading the weights again.

NInfer does not provide an install target or packaged binary. See the
[repository README](https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer#quick-start) for source-build dependencies.

## Download and run a CLI example

```bash
hf download neroued/Qwen3.8-27B-nvfp4-NInfer \
  qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer \
  --local-dir models

./build/apps/ninfer models/qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer \
  --prompt "Explain prefill and decode in three sentences." \
  --max-context 32768 \
  --max-new 8192 \
  --kv-dtype fp8 \
  --spec mtp --draft-tokens 3 \
  --lm-head-draft
```

For images, videos, and structured chat history, see the
[CLI guide](https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer/blob/master/docs/cli.md).

## Start a local server

```bash
./build/apps/ninfer-serve models/qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer \
  --host 127.0.0.1 \
  --port 8080 \
  --max-context 240000 \
  --kv-capacity 240000 \
  --max-concurrency 2 \
  --kv-dtype fp8 \
  --device-state-slots 2 \
  --host-state-slots 8 \
  --host-kv-mib 8192 \
  --spec mtp --draft-tokens 3 \
  --lm-head-draft \
  --preserve-thinking
```

Each request has a 240,000-token logical ceiling. The shared 240,000-token Device KV pool admits
two active requests when their combined completion reservations fit; either request may use the
full pool while running alone. Two extra Device checkpoint slots, eight pinned Host State slots,
and 8 GiB of pinned Host KV retain reusable continuations under resource pressure.

See the [HTTP serving guide](https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer/blob/master/docs/serving.md) for the
API surface and the [resource scheduling reference](https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer/blob/master/docs/maintainer/resource-scheduling-and-context-cache.md)
for cache and admission semantics.

### Tensor-parallel-2 (TP-2) on two RTX 5060 Ti

This artifact does not fit on one 16 GiB card (about 20.2 GiB of resident weights). On two
identical RTX 5060 Ti (16 GiB) cards, serve it with the TP-2 core:

```bash
./build/apps/ninfer-serve models/qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer \
  --devices 0,1 \
  --kv-dtype fp8 --max-context 262144 --kv-capacity auto \
  --spec mtp --draft-tokens 2 --lm-head-draft
```

The full 262,144-token context fits (15,614 / 15,094 MiB per card); sustained decode is about
59 tok/s with MTP K=2. The [dual RTX 5060 Ti TP-2 note](https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer/blob/master/docs/tp2-dual-5060ti.md)
records the memory budget, the recommended configuration, and the measurements, and the
[Windows native build guide](https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer/blob/master/docs/windows.md) covers
the native two-card setup.

## Supported use

The artifact supports:

- text generation in thinking and non-thinking modes;
- image, multi-image, video, and mixed multimodal messages;
- MTP speculative decoding with draft windows from one to five;
- DFlash2 with draft windows from one to fifteen using the included
  DFlash2 companion weights (`--spec dflash2 --draft-tokens 7`, optionally `--lm-head-draft`);
- BF16, INT8, FP8, NVFP4, and K8V4 KV cache;
- CUDA Graph decode and compatible-prefix reuse;
- startup-bounded small-scale concurrent serving with true batched decode;
- the NInfer CLI;
- OpenAI Responses Core, OpenAI Chat Completions, and Anthropic Messages serving.

## Performance

The MTP0 measurements below were collected at NInfer revision
[`f08597d`](https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer/commit/f08597d6eaafce5b875934aaa85854fcd5426df8),
and the MTP3 measurements at revision
[`32c9881`](https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer/commit/32c9881b6783949df4999422a764b3dcaa111b13).
Both campaigns used one NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090, CUDA 13.1 compile/runtime, CUDA driver API 13.3,
stochastic sampling, INT8 group-64 KV, CUDA Graphs, a 1,024-token prefill chunk, and prefix reuse
disabled. MTP0 used no speculative backend and a 262,144-token context limit; MTP3 used a
131,072-token per-request context limit and three draft tokens.

### Concurrent MTP=3 corpus makespan

The fixed corpus contains three long-reasoning and twelve cross-scenario fixtures with five seeds
each, for 75 requests. Every concurrency point starts a fresh server and uses the same shuffle seed
and ordered HTTP send sequence. C=1 is the serial single-request corpus. Makespan includes prefill,
decode, workload transitions, and final drain.

| C | Requests | Decode tokens | Makespan | Requests/s | Corpus decode (tok/s) | Avg batch | MTP acceptance | Speedup |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 75 | 752,160 | 4,670.27 s | 0.0161 | 161.1 | 1.00 | 60.8% | 1.00× |
| 2 | 75 | 739,951 | 2,510.78 s | 0.0299 | 294.7 | 1.98 | 59.2% | 1.86× |
| 4 | 75 | 713,384 | 1,647.74 s | 0.0455 | 432.9 | 3.29 | 58.0% | 2.83× |
| 8 | 75 | 723,602 | 2,164.90 s | 0.0346 | 334.2 | 2.36 | 57.6% | 2.16× |

All 300 requests completed without a request, CUDA, or out-of-memory failure. C=4 gives the
shortest complete-corpus makespan. C=8 is limited by memory pressure, which makes its
complete-corpus result slower than C=4. Sampling is stochastic, so the fixed prompts and seeds do
not imply token-identical continuations across concurrency-specific numerical routes; exact
decode-token totals are shown above.

### Long-context baseline (MTP disabled)

Each value is the arithmetic mean ± sample standard deviation over five fixed seeds after server
warm-up.

| Prompt tokens | Prefill phase (tok/s) | Server TTFT (ms) | Decode phase (tok/s) |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 7,680 | 8,340.4 ± 13.0 | 931.6 ± 1.6 | 71.2 ± 0.1 |
| 64,512 | 5,297.9 ± 259.2 | 12,281.1 ± 561.5 | 65.7 ± 0.8 |
| 130,048 | 3,544.7 ± 25.3 | 36,853.5 ± 259.4 | 59.6 ± 0.9 |
| 260,096 | 2,203.1 ± 13.4 | 118,354.8 ± 717.2 | 52.9 ± 2.3 |

### MTP=3 single-request long-reasoning decode

The C=1 point supplies five samples for each fixture. Values are arithmetic mean ± sample standard
deviation from server phase timings and speculative counters.

| AIME 2026 fixture | Completion tokens | Decode phase (tok/s) | MTP acceptance | MTP tokens/round |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Problem 1 | 1,465.4 ± 417.3 | 195.2 ± 4.6 | 76.0% ± 2.4% | 3.28 ± 0.07 |
| Problem 15 | 65,414.4 ± 271.9 | 151.4 ± 2.0 | 56.2% ± 1.1% | 2.69 ± 0.03 |
| Problem 30 | 50,023.4 ± 14,839.1 | 167.5 ± 23.7 | 64.6% ± 14.9% | 2.94 ± 0.45 |

### MTP=3 single-request cross-scenario decode

Each category contains three fixtures and five seeds per fixture, for 15 samples.

| Category | Decode phase (tok/s) | MTP acceptance | MTP tokens/round |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Code | 194.3 ± 6.1 | 76.4% ± 3.9% | 3.29 ± 0.12 |
| Story | 126.1 ± 10.9 | 37.4% ± 5.8% | 2.12 ± 0.17 |
| Translation | 192.3 ± 11.9 | 75.0% ± 6.5% | 3.25 ± 0.19 |
| Structured output | 219.8 ± 8.6 | 90.8% ± 5.1% | 3.72 ± 0.15 |

[full methodology and results](https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer/blob/master/docs/performance/qwen3.8-27b.md)
for metric definitions and the exact reproduction command.

## Evaluation

The artifact was evaluated through NInfer's OpenAI-compatible serving route with thinking enabled,
MTP=3, and INT8 group-64 KV. EvalScope 1.9.0 used 0-shot prompts, rule-based scoring, and one sample
per problem with temperature 1.0, top-p 0.95, top-k 20, presence penalty 0.0, and seed 42. The text
suite ran at a 252,928-token context limit; the multimodal suite ran with `--vision` at a
81,920-token limit.

| Benchmark | NInfer NVFP4 | Correct / total | Official Qwen3.8-27B BF16 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| IFBench (prompt-level strict) | 77.00% | 231 / 300 | 79.5 |
| AIME 2025 | 96.67% | 29 / 30 | — |
| AIME 2026 | 96.67% | 29 / 30 | — |
| GPQA-Diamond | 90.40% | 179 / 198 | 89.2 |
| ERQA | 66.25% | 265 / 400 | 65.5 |
| RealWorldQA | 83.53% | 639 / 765 | 85.9 |

All 1,723 configured samples completed and were scored. IFBench additionally reports 80.50%
instruction-level strict, 80.33% prompt-level loose, and 83.50% instruction-level loose. These are
single-sample results, not pass@k.

The official Qwen3.8-27B BF16 figures come from the
[upstream model card](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B); its sampling settings and IFBench
metric level are not stated there, so the last column is not a same-protocol comparison. The NVFP4
deltas stay within ±2.5 points on the four overlapping benchmarks, and the upstream card reports no
AIME results.

## Limits

- NInfer executes on one RTX 5090 (or one TP-2 pair of identical RTX 5060 Ti cards on the server
  route) and one resident model, with a startup-fixed capacity of 1–8 active requests per Engine
  (the TP-2 route runs one request at a time).
- It does not provide large-scale or preemptive continuous batching, priority/QoS scheduling,
  general multi-GPU execution, CPU/GPU offload, or distributed serving.
- Context allocation is subject to GPU memory and the selected KV-cache type.
- NInfer does not execute generated tool calls.
