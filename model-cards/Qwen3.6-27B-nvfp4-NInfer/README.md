# Qwen3.6-27B NVFP4 for NInfer

This model card is the version-controlled source for
[neroued/Qwen3.6-27B-nvfp4-NInfer](https://huggingface.co/neroued/Qwen3.6-27B-nvfp4-NInfer).

The repository contains the NVFP4 representation of
[Qwen3.6-27B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.6-27B), converted from the fixed packed weights in
[rdtand/Qwen3.6-27B-PrismaSCOUT-Blackwell-NVFP4-BF16-vllm](https://huggingface.co/rdtand/Qwen3.6-27B-PrismaSCOUT-Blackwell-NVFP4-BF16-vllm)
to the native [NInfer](https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer) `.ninfer` artifact format. The artifact is
intended only for NInfer; it is not a Transformers checkpoint, Safetensors distribution, or GGUF
file.

The artifact uses the Qwen3.5 Dense architecture with mixed NVFP4/BF16 weights. Actual bindings and
activation permissions select the native execution paths, including W4A4 Tensor Core prefill and
A16 NVFP4 decode. Text, Vision, MTP, prefix reuse, CLI and serving use the common Engine route.

| Container version | 3 |
| Architecture | `Qwen3_5ForCausalLM` |
| Public model name | `qwen3.6-27b` |
| Chat template | [qwen3_6.jinja](https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer/blob/98dada0e03cb073fd07f905400b5904bc6e82759/tools/chat_templates/qwen3_6.jinja); override with `--chat-template FILE` |
| Template defaults | thinking on; closed-turn reasoning omitted |
| Stored objects | 1,545 (1,539 tensors and 6 resources) |
| NVFP4 tensors | 247 |

The file contains Text, Vision, MTP, the optimized proposal head, and frontend resources. Text
linears use the source repository's mixed NVFP4/BF16 allocation; vocabulary and MTP projections
use Q8. Vision and speculative weights are loaded only when selected at startup.

```

## Requirements

- [NInfer](https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer) revision
  [`98dada0`](https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer/commit/98dada0e03cb073fd07f905400b5904bc6e82759)
  or later, built from source;
- 64-bit Linux;
- NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 (`sm_120a`);
- CUDA Toolkit 13.1 or newer.

Already have the official v2 file? [Upgrade it locally](https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer/blob/master/docs/weight-conversion.md#upgrade-an-existing-v2-artifact)
without downloading the weights again.

NInfer does not provide an install target or packaged binary. See the
[repository README](https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer#quick-start) for source-build dependencies.

## Download and run a CLI example

```bash
hf download neroued/Qwen3.6-27B-nvfp4-NInfer \
  qwen3_6_27b_nvfp4.ninfer \
  --local-dir models

./build/apps/ninfer models/qwen3_6_27b_nvfp4.ninfer \
  --prompt "Explain prefill and decode in three sentences." \
  --max-context 32768 \
  --max-new 8192 \
  --kv-dtype fp8 \
  --spec mtp --draft-tokens 3 \
  --lm-head-draft
```

For images, videos, and structured chat history, see the
[CLI guide](https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer/blob/master/docs/cli.md).

## Start a local server

```bash
./build/apps/ninfer-serve models/qwen3_6_27b_nvfp4.ninfer \
  --host 127.0.0.1 \
  --port 8080 \
  --max-context 240000 \
  --kv-capacity 240000 \
  --max-concurrency 2 \
  --kv-dtype fp8 \
  --device-state-slots 2 \
  --host-state-slots 8 \
  --host-kv-mib 8192 \
  --spec mtp --draft-tokens 3 \
  --lm-head-draft \
  --preserve-thinking
```

Each request has a 240,000-token logical ceiling. The shared 240,000-token Device KV pool admits
two active requests when their combined completion reservations fit; either request may use the
full pool while running alone. Two extra Device checkpoint slots, eight pinned Host State slots,
and 8 GiB of pinned Host KV retain reusable continuations under resource pressure.

See the [HTTP serving guide](https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer/blob/master/docs/serving.md) for the
API surface and the [resource scheduling reference](https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer/blob/master/docs/maintainer/resource-scheduling-and-context-cache.md)
for cache and admission semantics.

## Supported use

The artifact supports:

- text generation in thinking and non-thinking modes;
- image, multi-image, video, and mixed multimodal messages;
- MTP speculative decoding with draft windows from one to five;
- BF16, INT8, FP8, NVFP4, and K8V4 KV cache;
- CUDA Graph decode and compatible-prefix reuse;
- startup-bounded small-scale concurrent serving with true batched decode;
- the NInfer CLI;
- OpenAI Responses Core, OpenAI Chat Completions, and Anthropic Messages serving.

## Performance

The single-request serving measurements below were collected on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 with
CUDA 13.1 compile/runtime and CUDA driver API 13.3. Requests were submitted serially to a persistent
`ninfer-serve` process with CUDA Graph enabled, a 1,024-token prefill chunk, INT8 group-64 KV cache,
and prefix reuse disabled. Each single-request value is the arithmetic mean ± sample standard
deviation over five fixed seeds; server warm-up completes before the measured requests.

### Concurrent MTP=3 decode saturation

The concurrent campaign uses one 293-token prompt followed by an 8,192-token generation per active
request. Each concurrency point starts a fresh server with MTP3, INT8 group-64 KV, CUDA Graphs, a
16,384-token per-request context limit, and prefix reuse disabled. Aggregate throughput includes
only complete one-second intervals whose actual decode batch remains equal to C. Each row is one
sustained wave.

| C | Steady decode (tok/s) | Speedup vs. C1 | Wave makespan |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 202.4 | 1.00× | 40.46 s |
| 2 | 399.7 | 1.97× | 41.82 s |
| 4 | 699.7 | 3.46× | 47.92 s |
| 8 | 1,146.9 | 5.67× | 58.57 s |

At C=8, the profile sustains **1,146.9 aggregate decode tok/s**, or **5.67×** its C=1 throughput.

### Long-context baseline (MTP disabled)

| Prompt tokens | Prefill phase (tok/s) | Server TTFT (ms) | Decode phase (tok/s) |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 7,680 | 11,191.5 ± 70.2 | 692.5 ± 4.3 | 86.4 ± 0.5 |
| 64,512 | 6,298.5 ± 97.6 | 10,288.6 ± 159.3 | 78.0 ± 1.2 |
| 130,048 | 4,204.7 ± 14.1 | 31,012.5 ± 104.6 | 71.2 ± 0.2 |
| 260,096 | 2,510.6 ± 16.8 | 103,761.1 ± 698.8 | 59.9 ± 0.3 |

At 7,680 prompt tokens this is 3.48× the prefill throughput of the published groupwise-int profile;
at 260,096 prompt tokens it is 1.55×.

### MTP=3 long-reasoning decode

Thinking was enabled and the output limit was 65,536 tokens.

| AIME 2026 fixture | Completion tokens | Decode phase (tok/s) | MTP acceptance | MTP tokens/round |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Problem 1 | 12,053.4 ± 820.9 | 231.0 ± 3.0 | 80.2% ± 1.2% | 3.41 ± 0.04 |
| Problem 15 | 63,109.0 ± 5,426.9 | 213.1 ± 4.2 | 76.3% ± 2.0% | 3.29 ± 0.06 |
| Problem 30 | 57,166.4 ± 9,204.9 | 223.3 ± 1.8 | 81.1% ± 1.5% | 3.43 ± 0.04 |

### MTP=3 cross-scenario decode

Each category contains three fixtures and five seeds per fixture (15 samples). Thinking was
disabled and the output limit was 4,096 tokens.

| Category | Decode phase (tok/s) | MTP acceptance | MTP tokens/round |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Code | 220.3 ± 8.2 | 74.2% ± 4.0% | 3.23 ± 0.12 |
| Story | 148.8 ± 11.6 | 39.2% ± 5.7% | 2.18 ± 0.17 |
| Translation | 213.6 ± 12.2 | 70.5% ± 6.0% | 3.12 ± 0.18 |
| Structured output | 252.2 ± 16.3 | 89.8% ± 8.0% | 3.69 ± 0.24 |

## Evaluation

The historical serving revision was `b3d4d0f50b868711c62432bbd68e746217a2f49a`.
See the [evaluation workflow](https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer/blob/master/eval/README.md#historical-qwen36-27b-reasoning-profile)
for the serving and runner commands.

The artifact was evaluated through NInfer's OpenAI-compatible serving route with thinking enabled,
MTP=3, and a 262,144-token context limit. EvalScope 1.9.0 used 0-shot prompts, rule-based scoring,
and one sample per problem with temperature 0.6, top-p 0.95, top-k 20, presence penalty 1.0, and
seed 42. All 258 configured samples completed and were scored.

| Benchmark | Accuracy | Correct / total |
|---|---:|---:|
| AIME 2025 | 93.33% | 28 / 30 |
| AIME 2026 | 93.33% | 28 / 30 |
| GPQA-Diamond | 84.34% | 167 / 198 |

These are single-sample results under the stated NInfer evaluation profile, not pass@k scores.

## Limits

- NInfer executes on one RTX 5090 and one CUDA device, with a startup-fixed capacity of 1–8 active
  requests per Engine.
- It does not provide large-scale or preemptive continuous batching, priority/QoS scheduling,
  multi-GPU execution, CPU/GPU offload, or distributed serving.
- Context allocation is subject to GPU memory and the selected KV-cache type.
- NInfer does not execute generated tool calls.
