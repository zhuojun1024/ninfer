# Qwen3.8-27B for NInfer

This model card is the version-controlled source for
[neroued/Qwen3.8-27B-NInfer](https://huggingface.co/neroued/Qwen3.8-27B-NInfer).

The repository contains
[Qwen3.8-27B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B) converted to the native
[NInfer](https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer) `.ninfer` artifact format. The artifact is intended
only for NInfer; it is not a Transformers checkpoint, Safetensors distribution, or GGUF file.

## Artifact

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Filename | `qwen3_8_27b.ninfer` |
| Size | 20,437,521,664 bytes (19.03 GiB) |
| SHA-256 | `81f924d440c27261d820c19a9f8d45794c5aee410f8a68bd358133fa8c0375da` |
| Container version | 3 |
| Architecture | `Qwen3_5ForCausalLM` |
| Public model name | `qwen3.8-27b` |
| Chat template | [qwen3_8.jinja](https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer/blob/98dada0e03cb073fd07f905400b5904bc6e82759/tools/chat_templates/qwen3_8.jinja); override with `--chat-template FILE` |
| Template defaults | thinking on; effort `xhigh`; closed-turn reasoning retained |
| Stored objects | 1,190 (1,184 tensors and 6 resources) |

The Text body uses Q4/Q5 projections, while the token embedding and full output head use
`q8_g32_fp16`. The file also contains Vision, MTP, DFlash2, the optimized proposal head and
frontend resources. Vision and speculative weights are loaded only when selected at startup.

Verify a downloaded file with:

```bash
printf '%s  %s\n' \
  '81f924d440c27261d820c19a9f8d45794c5aee410f8a68bd358133fa8c0375da' \
  'qwen3_8_27b.ninfer' | sha256sum --check
```

This release includes the complete DFlash2 companion weights from
`z-lab/Qwen3.8-27B-DFlash2` at revision
`50307d4c4cde6860d4eee73e2547cd786fe8e8a4`. Select
`--spec dflash2 --draft-tokens 7 --lm-head-draft`; draft counts 1..15 are supported.
DFlash2 requires the runtime revision listed below. Existing performance and evaluation tables
retain their stated MTP configurations and revisions.

## Requirements

- [NInfer](https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer) revision
  [`04350ba9`](https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer/commit/98dada0e03cb073fd07f905400b5904bc6e82759)
  or later, built from source;
- 64-bit Linux or native Windows;
- an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090, or two identical RTX 5060 Ti cards (TP-2, server
  route only);
- CUDA Toolkit 13.1 or newer (Linux), or CUDA 13.3 with Visual Studio 2022 (Windows).

Already have the official v2 file? [Upgrade it locally](https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer/blob/master/docs/weight-conversion.md#upgrade-an-existing-v2-artifact)
without downloading the weights again.

NInfer does not provide an install target or packaged binary. See the
[repository README](https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer#quick-start) for source-build dependencies.

## Download and run a CLI example

```bash
hf download neroued/Qwen3.8-27B-NInfer \
  qwen3_8_27b.ninfer \
  --local-dir models

./build/apps/ninfer models/qwen3_8_27b.ninfer \
  --prompt "Explain prefill and decode in three sentences." \
  --max-context 32768 \
  --max-new 8192 \
  --kv-dtype fp8 \
  --spec mtp --draft-tokens 3 \
  --lm-head-draft
```

For images, videos, and structured chat history, see the
[CLI guide](https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer/blob/master/docs/cli.md).

## Start a local server

```bash
./build/apps/ninfer-serve models/qwen3_8_27b.ninfer \
  --host 127.0.0.1 \
  --port 8080 \
  --max-context 240000 \
  --kv-capacity 240000 \
  --max-concurrency 2 \
  --kv-dtype fp8 \
  --device-state-slots 2 \
  --host-state-slots 8 \
  --host-kv-mib 8192 \
  --spec mtp --draft-tokens 3 \
  --lm-head-draft \
  --preserve-thinking
```

Each request has a 240,000-token logical ceiling. The shared 240,000-token Device KV pool admits
two active requests when their combined completion reservations fit; either request may use the
full pool while running alone. Two extra Device checkpoint slots, eight pinned Host State slots,
and 8 GiB of pinned Host KV retain reusable continuations under resource pressure.

See the [HTTP serving guide](https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer/blob/master/docs/serving.md) for the
API surface and the [resource scheduling reference](https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer/blob/master/docs/maintainer/resource-scheduling-and-context-cache.md)
for cache and admission semantics.

### Tensor-parallel-2 (TP-2) on two RTX 5060 Ti

This artifact (19.03 GiB) does not fit on one 16 GiB card. On two identical RTX 5060 Ti (16 GiB)
cards, serve it with the TP-2 core (`--devices 0,1`). The [dual RTX 5060 Ti TP-2 note](https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer/blob/master/docs/tp2-dual-5060ti.md)
records the verified configuration, memory budget, and measurements (measured on the NVFP4
artifact), and the [Windows native build guide](https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer/blob/master/docs/windows.md)
covers the native two-card setup.

## Supported use

The artifact supports:

- text generation in thinking and non-thinking modes;
- image, multi-image, video, and mixed multimodal messages;
- MTP speculative decoding with draft windows from one to five;
- DFlash2 with draft windows from one to fifteen using the included
  DFlash2 companion weights (`--spec dflash2 --draft-tokens 7`, optionally `--lm-head-draft`);
- BF16, INT8, FP8, NVFP4, and K8V4 KV cache;
- CUDA Graph decode and compatible-prefix reuse;
- startup-bounded small-scale concurrent serving with true batched decode;
- the NInfer CLI;
- OpenAI Responses Core, OpenAI Chat Completions, and Anthropic Messages serving.

## Evaluation

The artifact was evaluated through NInfer's OpenAI-compatible serving route with thinking enabled,
MTP=3, and INT8 group-64 KV. EvalScope 1.9.0 used 0-shot prompts, rule-based scoring, and one sample
per problem with temperature 1.0, top-p 0.95, top-k 20, presence penalty 0.0, and seed 42. The text
suite ran at a 262,144-token context limit; the multimodal suite ran with `--vision` at a
81,920-token limit.

| Benchmark | NInfer groupwise-int | Correct / total | Official Qwen3.8-27B BF16 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| IFBench (prompt-level strict) | 77.67% | 233 / 300 | 79.5 |
| AIME 2025 | 96.67% | 29 / 30 | — |
| AIME 2026 | 96.67% | 29 / 30 | — |
| GPQA-Diamond | 87.37% | 173 / 198 | 89.2 |
| ERQA | 66.25% | 265 / 400 | 65.5 |
| RealWorldQA | 82.22% | 629 / 765 | 85.9 |

All 1,723 configured samples completed and were scored. IFBench additionally reports 81.00%
instruction-level strict, 80.67% prompt-level loose, and 83.67% instruction-level loose. These are
single-sample results, not pass@k.

The official Qwen3.8-27B BF16 figures come from the
[upstream model card](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B); its sampling settings and IFBench
metric level are not stated there, so the last column is not a same-protocol comparison. The
groupwise-int deltas stay within ±3.1 points on the four overlapping benchmarks, and the upstream
card reports no AIME results.

## Limits

- NInfer executes on one RTX 5090 (or one TP-2 pair of identical RTX 5060 Ti cards on the server
  route) and one resident model, with a startup-fixed capacity of 1–8 active requests per Engine
  (the TP-2 route runs one request at a time).
- It does not provide large-scale or preemptive continuous batching, priority/QoS scheduling,
  general multi-GPU execution, CPU/GPU offload, or distributed serving.
- Context allocation is subject to GPU memory and the selected KV-cache type.
- NInfer does not execute generated tool calls.
